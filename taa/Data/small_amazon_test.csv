"Desert Noir: A Lena Jones Mystery: I like it a lot, now I am hooked on another series and will have to space out my purchases of this series of books, anyone who like mysteries would like this one.",2
"Not Parker's Best: Another reviewer started the review with ""I love Mr. Parker's books"". I agree, especially Spencer books, however, ""Widow's Walk"" does not measure up to earlier Spencers. The storyline is old, Susan is tiresome and I, for one, am tired of Robert B. Parker using Spencer and Susan to lecture us on how poorly homosexuals are treated by the rest of the world. Bob, we read your books because they are smart, clever, and captivating, not to hear your sermons. A second problem with ""Widow's Walk"" is that we don't even see the bad guy's name until the end of the book. How can we begin to solve the crime with you if the charaters aren't introduced?I am glad to see Spencer back. When the next one comes out, I'll rush out and get it and read in an evening again, but when I am bored some evening and go for a reread, it won't be ""Widow's Walk"". Please Bob, its time for another ""Catskill Eagle"" or ""Judas Goat"". I can't recommend ""Widow's Walk"".",1
"Please stop playing this schmaltz!: I listen to a radio staion that only plays Christmas music and this song is played over and over and over. I LOVE Christmas music, but have never heard such annoying garbage - not since ""Butterfly Kisses"". The sentiment is so unsincere and nauseating I can't believe anyone would want to buy it. Ignore at all costs.",1
"What a disappointment: Considering the price of this book, I expected there to be some content. My suggestion would be to save your money and check the book out from the library; you can read it in about thirty minutes.",1
awesome game: I thought this was one of the best games ever. It is so awesome. Whatever U do B-U-Y I-T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,2
"winsome wood 20"" round table question about table height: i didn't see any other way to contact you to find out the table's height. this should be given but i didn't see it. i know it's 20"" round but how high is important. thanks gercoop@verizon.net gerry oconnor",1
"Awesome Music: This is some of the most awesome music I own. I play this over and over and over again! This lady has a powerful, incredible voice that drags you in, and you simply cannot stop listening to her!",2
"A book of medieval martial arts: This a very scholarly book; well reseached, and of very high quality in printing; indispensable to anybody who want to have a comprehensive idea of the martial arts of medieval Europe. The only thing I'd suggest to the publisher is to include a CD with demonstration of the techniques presented in the book.",2
"Holy Sensory Overload: Mega explosions, ultra car chases, repetitive buildings toppling---if this is your idea of testosterone fueled summer entertainment---then go for it. Oh yeah, multiple assassins around every corner. A brilliant concept almost completely ruined by too much action and too many characters. It becomes completely overwhelming when the dream within a dream, within a dream, within a dream, culminates in some sort of ""Ice Station Zebra(esque)"" nonsense. JEEZ--the audience needs a breather!DiCaprio's talents are completely wasted. The subplot with the dead wife was strangely reminiscent and done much better in ""Shutter Island."" Gordon-Levitt was miscast(way too young for the part). Ellen Page fares slightly better as the so-called ""dream architect.""Kudos for the awesome art direction and set design--I would bet my bottom dollar an Oscar or two is definetly in store.I really wanted to like this movie--but in an eggshell--it was just TOO MUCH.",1
"DIDN'T WORK: PRODUCT TOOK THREE WEEKS TO ARRIVE & WAS DEFECTIVE COULD NOT GET A REPLY BACK FROM SELLER. WHEN TRYING TO CONTACT SELLER, THE SITE WAS DOWN. DON'T PURCHASE THERE!!!!!!",1
"Pleasantville DVD: Bought as a gift for an 11 year old. Have not watched it yet, but I'm sure she'll love it.",2
"The best I've read on the Beatitudes.: I have been deeply influenced by the writings of Pastor John MacArthur. When I read his books, the Spirit in my heart is constantly saying :""Yes!"". When I search the Scriptures I find nothing but confirmation of his teachings. He does not show us the easy path, he does not teach us, what Bonhoeffer calls ""cheap grace"". In my opinion he shows us the path of true discipleship. I use his books in my teaching and in my preaching. May God bless you, Pastor!",2
"Horrible design: Tested out the case of out-of-battery. The receiver stays at its last known state, when the battery is transmitter's battery is dead. Thus, if the battery dies while the garage door is down, the receiver will always indicate that the garage door is down, regardless of actual situation.",1
A bad impression: I really disliked this book I think you can find a better source downloading a tutorial from the Internet. I am sorry that I bought this book.,1
"great service: Advantage Dog 11-20lb (Teal)Ordered the Advantage Flea treatment for our dog recently. Quick service and delivery, no problems, and will look to purchase from this seller again.",2
"not good at all...: I bought this book at the end of the semester to review for the gross anatomy shelf exam. I quickly discovered that the text is horrible, diagrams lacking, and the questions are FULL of errors. I loved BRS neuroanatomy and physiology, but this book isn't very good. I put it down after half a day of frustration and just focused on Netters (and kicked butt on the shelf).",1
"DO NOT BUY!! samsung model number LN T4042 H: I agree with the other review $1200 and 2 1/2 years later, the TV won't turn! I have a Zenith from 1993 that works perfect!!! Never an issue. I will never buy Samsung anything ever again.",1
"Julie Powell, I don't like you: I had such high hopes for this book and have been sorely disappointed. I've only read about half of it and am making myself finish it since I paid full price for it. Reading should not be a chore. There is so much wrong with it I can't cover it all but here are my major complaints:First of all Julie is downright obnoxious. There is nothing likeable about her. She is whiny, crass, and extremely vulgar. This book is also full of profanity. And I am appalled at her cold feelings towards 9-11 victims. I'm glad I'm not the only one who noticed that. Second, this book has hardly anything to do with cooking. The author mentions the recipes almost as an afterthought. Third, she completely overwrites and I'm finding my mind wondering on nearly every single page. I am no psychic, but I am rather comfortable predicting that her newest book will be a complete and utter failure. I can see why Julia Child wanted no part in this.",1
"Step AWAY from the crack!: I noticed a similarity between Ann Coulter and Joe McCarthy... They both say something extremely stupid, and people actually start believing them. I'm sure that if you dig deep enough, you can discover that... Hitler was actually a Jew!",1
"Good Jump Rope: I have two jump ropes -- this beaded one and a lighter, non-beaded cord. This one is faster and if it catches on your shoe, it won't completely stop you like the lighter more advanced ropes (which can be very irritating and could discourage the beginner). Easily adjustable and generally a fantastic way to stay fit even while you travel. And I do travel with it. Gets your heart rate up fast and keeps it there. You also need very little room for the exercise and it is quiet on carpet so it won't wake up the whole house or the hotel neighbor next door.",2
AUSOME: This doll is pretty cool. I have had here for a while. The only thing i do not like is that you get a surfboard with her but you cant really use it. Other than that she rox :D She also has tan skin.,2
"Disappointing: I have read several of the Capital Crimes novels, and felt very disappointed with this story. I realize that not every book can be top notch, but this book fell very short of the standards for author Margaret Truman. I realize that a plot and characters have to be developed to create the story and mystery, but the first half if not more of this book were characters going to lunch/dinner with someone trying the get the ""juice"" out of the drama behind the mysteries tapes from former Mafia player. I suggest that unless you really want to say that you've read all the Mysteries, I would skip this copy.",1
"Alum Block: This product works great for after your shave with a safety razor or straight razor. It really takes the irritation away. I've noticed that it stings a little at first but, that's because of the irritation. After running it over your face a few times, the stinging goes away and that's when you know that you've taken care of the irritation issue. This item also provides you the opportunity to really feel if you've missed any areas or if there were any pesky places that didn't get quite enough shaving. You really can feel the stubble as you run the alum block over those areas. I use this product in conjunction with Geo F. Trumper Skin Food for the perfect baby butt smooth feeling that my girlfriend loves.",2
"Disappointing: Though it's good to see that at last someone has written a book on Burroughs from a queer perspective, the author has such a limited and rigid idea of what counts as queer criticism that the book ultimately ignores most of what is interesting in Burroughs's fiction. The chapter on Naked Lunch, for example, focuses entirely on some rather questionable ideas about how to historicize the queer identity available in the 1950s, and thus ends up ignoring everything that is funny or satirical in a novel that is essentially comic and satirical (as well as being savage and caustic). The result is that every novel is viewed from a partial perspective that makes the book seem entirely thesis-driven, to the point that it simply ignores whatever is not grist for the author's mill.",1
Awesome gift: I bought these for my 9 year old grandson for christmas. It was the hit of his gifts. That weekend we went to the rink and he LOVES them. They are fast and he can stay on them perfectly. Of al his gifts I think he will get the most use out of these. They are very sturdy ad will last a long tine,2
expired date: I bought this case on 2/25/07.When I received the case all packages had a sell by date of 01/25/07.Very disappointing when you are trying to resell something outdated!!,1
"Not what i expected: when i first viewed this item on amazon, i really thought it was gonna be cheesy and kinda lame. however i was still interested in buying it so i found at borders and bought it. its taken me several days to finish it but i just finished the last episode and i really must say that i really liked it. it may not be the best show in the world but its great for entertainment and the characters can be loveable.my favorites are nicole and mary cheery but i aslo liked brooke. carmen at the beginning was a bit of a good character but she started to get on my nerves. the ending however was very shocking when she (do not read this part if you have never seen it and dont want to ruin it) says shes pregnant! is she pregnant from josh? oh wow if so thats gonna be really bad since brooke and josh just got together.anyway i think overall its a good show and i liked it a lot and i have to say that caged is the best episode.",2
"Gravity works: The fold-up feature of this bar looks nice on paper, but doesn't work. When it's folded up it is top-heavy and ends up falling onto the floor, making it difficult to open and close the door.",1
"Good hard SF, fast-paced and intelligent: An enjoyable read, hard to put down. Not quite one of his best, but if you like Bear, well worth it...",2
"A lot of information and help here on meditation practices: Exploring meditation explains eastern and western systems of meditation in great detail. This is an exploration and explanation of many meditaion practices, traditions and of the foundations of meditation. It has expanded my understanding and places my practice into perspective. This a great book that I return to when I want to deepen my understanding.",2
"Just don't like it: After losing one of our Gerber Sip n smile cups (which we love), I bought one of these to replace it. Boy was that a mistake! The spout is way harder and although it is possible, it is extremely difficult to line up the spout and handles properly. My son won't even drink from it. Oh, and it can leak. Waste of money. Go for the sip n smile cups. They're awesome for young babies.",1
vapo rub: nothing more than vapo rup. hot menthol.used buned us both ky product much better. not for us. will not try other menthol products.,1
"cracked disk: I was so excited to receive this in the mail from amazon, only to find that the 1st disk was cracked and would not work!!!! Why doesn't Amazon just send in a return mailer when the item is shipped?? Very disappointed in Amazon.",1
"Rewriting History: I didn't have much hope for this movie, but it sounded fun, so we went and watched it. It was okay (not brilliant or anything)... Until the meeting of the villian. The writers of this movie have displaced the story of Elizabeth Bathory (aka the Female Dracula). From that point, I was unable to enjoy it. If they had changed her name instead of rewriting her story, it would have remained an okay movie.",1
"Better revisit 16 Lighthouse Road before reading this: I am a Debbie Macomber fan-""natic"" from way back...so I was anxiously awaiting the release of this book (mostly to find out what happened to Dan.)This book was very hard to follow. It was almost as if the whole town took to talking to Debbie at once and she hurried to capture everything they were saying in the mere 378 3/4 pages she had. I needed a flow chart to figure out who the characters were and found myself wondering whether any of the stories were ever going to move forward.I imagine since Debbie's letter hinted at 15 books (see I am a geek and even read her letters) and this is merely number 2 there are a lot of character lines that needed to be introduced. I just was hoping for a bit more substance to the stories she had started in 16 Lighthouse Road.I am looking forward to 311 Pelican Court but perhaps with not as much anticipation.",1
Pretty useless as a workout tool.: I'm very disappointed in this item. It only works if you can hold it flat and completely still and since I wanted it to monitor my heart rate during exercise . . . It is also not very accurate. Pulse is typically 10-15 beats off. Might as well just hold your fingers on your wrist or neck and save the money.,1
"Wrong Size: The website said size 6 Mens, the shoes were actually size 6 Womens, and the return process was designed so that I couldn't actually return them for shoes in the right size.",1
"Accurate Hitler: I cannot imagine a better portrayal of Adolf Hitler will ever cross our screens. As far as will ever be known the events shown here are totally accurate. These people were not monsters, they were human beings who perpetrated monstrous acts, a fact this film personifies. Even if WW2 doesn't appeal to you watch this one.",2
"Ironically it seems to cause an allergic reaction on me.: As one reviewer has already mentioned this product seemed to cause an allergic reaction on me as well. I have worn it twice only on my face ears and neck. Both times I had swelling under my eyes, hives on neck, and very itchy ears. Does anyone know what ingredient in this product could cause such a reaction in some users? I would really like to know what is different about this sunscreen so I can avoid it in others as well. If anyone knows, please advise. The reaction lasts several days.",1
"Know what you're paying for--- 15 minutes long: Although this video is educational and interesting, it is only 15 minutes long. Great for students in a class, but not for home viewing on the subject of Christmas traditions in Spain. They could have done so much more with it. Way too expensive for what it is!",1
"Good Controller, questionable durability.: I have bought this controller twice now, and am now about to buy it for a third time. The responsiveness of the controller is perfect, just like a wire controller. The comfort of the controller is slightly off at first if you're used to the stock controller, but is easily adjusted to. I love this controller. It is great for all of the games, and I am about to buy it again and that is the problem. The controllers last me about a year before the buttons start to stick in. My first wireless controller had one of the top button start sticking, and then the left analog stick wasn't responding right. My current controller has an X button that likes to stay down at inopportune times. I am not a serious gamer, these controllers should last better.Bottom line: Great controller if you don't mind refreshing it every year.",2
"The Queen of Hip Hop Soul does it again: This is a nice show if you've never seen Mary live this is a great example of one of her mind blowing shows, you'll love the energy and the vibez.",2
Simple - The Best Movie Ever Made: It's very easy to write this review. Casablanca is the greatest and the blue-ray disk displays the movie perfectly. Watch it over and over.,2
"Twisted and Haunting: This is a great story, but it's especially well done as an audio book. After reading it and then listening to it (library copies) a couple years later I just bought a copy for myself. The readers both do a splendid job.",2
Looks and feels cheap!: One thing for sure..it get the job done.All I need to power my psp .The price is right!Get if your low on funds...but I would honestly tell to buy official Sony product.I fear that this could over charger my psp.well so far none this has happen to my psp.but it could..You know the deal you get what you pay for! Injoy you psp...until you get a psp vita.,2
"I'm amazed daily at how well the techniques work!: I have a 2.5 year old and have been using the techniques described in this book for a year. It has been a great help. I'm amazed every day that techniques I initially thought would work ""someday when he's older"" work immediately, such as helping him to name his emotion when he starts a tantrum - most of the time I can help him stop within seconds - and brainstorming a list of options to a problem worked even with a 2 year old - he came up with ideas I wouldn't have thought of that were agreeable to both of us. I give this book as a gift at baby showers!",2
screwed: I'm not sure how I would have liked them since they sent me a round cut instead of the Princess cut I ordered. These are dishonest people. Buyer beware! They never responded to email..,1
"THIS IS NOT A MAKITA OEM BRAND BATTERY! IT'S A CHINESE KNOCK-OFF!: JUST A HEADS UP PEOPLE! THIS IS NOT AN OEM MAKITA BRAND BATTERY. IT IS AN UNLABELED CHINESE KNOCK-OFF. I contacted the seller and they sent me an almost unintelligible email stating that this was somehow Amazons fault. That Amazon changed the wording on the item. I have no idea, but I'm sending it back.From the looks of the item, I can't even tell what drill it goes with. It's literally just a plain green battery with some type of serial number printed on the back. If you don't mind getting a generic battery (have no idea how well they actually work or how long they last) then have at it, but at least know you aren't getting the OEM Makita branded item pictured on this page.",1
"Boring and Predictable: I hate to say this but this release bored me to death.The guitar tone is weak, the playing is okay, some of theriffs are cool. The vocalist is too ""Joe Death Metal"" for mytastes. I can't say it's the worst thing I've ever heard it'sjust that if I'm going to put on any I.B disc it's going tobe their demos and their first 2 cd's...Every song on this disckinda starts off the same: the intros are intense and intricate,then it turns to boring mosh metal. Sorry guys I know you can do better...",1
Raw super hero movie: Not one to watch with the kids but was very entertaining. Seemed like a National Lampoonesque superhero movie. Very violent scenes were suprising - like Mortal combat almost.Fun to watch!,2
"Weak: This is not a very good book.Rather than being about the `wake of the plague', most of the book rambles all over the place and in particular addresses the period before the plague struck Europe. Only the last, smallest, chapter specifically deals with events after the 1348-50 plague.The author makes frequent personal judgements on events and persons of the period and injects his own views, some of which are unpleasant, into the narrative.One would do better to read McNeill, Horrox, Cohn, Kelly, or Oldstone.",1
"Best Test Preparation for the Msat Multiple Subjects Assessm: This book was a tremendous help. I used it as my primary study guide and I passed the exam on my first try! Give yourself plenty of time to read through it though - the information is highly condensed. I also used the Cliffs Notes book and the ""What your ... needs to know"" series. Good luck!",2
My all-time favorite! Luv the whole collection!: I really love this Home Alone it is my favorite christmas movie. My child watches all of them throughout the year so they love it too! Oh how wonderful & fun family entertainment too!,2
not that interesting: the main character really just whines a lot. The story describes a man who is a self-professed boob. Not edifying writing unless you enjoy men-bashing,1
"For fans: I love Berlin - and have done since I heard No More Words when it was first released.I love Terri Nunn - she is STILL sexy, and has a great rock voice.The quality of this DVD, however, is APPALLING!Playing in DTS doesn't make the slightest of difference. The mixing sounds like its been done by an amateur, and the video looks like its been shot on a series of home video cameras.I have many music DVD's, and honestly, this is the worst quality in my collection - lucky I'm a fan otherwise I would send it back!Another annoying thing is they seem to have resorted to a technique a lot of older music videos used - an interview between tracks. The beauty of a DVD is you can skip to menus and sub-menus to CHOOSE what you want to watch. Mind you, Terri's words were quite interesting,, but not in the middle of the songs PLEASE!Overall, the production of this DVD is AMATEURISH at best. Very, very unfortunate as Terri Nunn and Berlin are a great band this DVD does not do them justice AT ALL!",1
"not very good...: i've read dozens of outlines in this biblical vien. read, 'what the bible is all about for young explorers' by henrietta mears. so far it's the best outline i've found.",1
"Not Correct for 2003 Honda CR-V: In spite of being led here by the ""What fits my car"" feature, it's not the right shape or size for a 2003 CR-V.Hopefully, amazon sees this and my return, and they fix the database! (The 2003 CRV wants a CA9493)",1
"Don't buy this for landscaping: I needed landscape design software, and since all the other products had gotten poor reviews and this software had not, I decided to try it. No one else had mentioned the landscape portion of the software, so I didn't really know what to expect. I'm sure this program is fine if you want to design a house, or an addition to your house, but if you desire lanscaping software, pass. The plant library is very small and does not include many common landscaping plants, and you can forget about finding something exotic or unusual. The software only allows one to draw circular or kidney shaped beds. Yes, you can attempt to drag the beds to the desired dimensions, but the effect is less than desirable. For landscaping, this was an expensive dud.",1
"Quick moving fantasy novel: This was the first book I read by Patricia Briggs and after reading her introduction, I was prepared to find the writing flawed. But the book turned out to be quite a page turner with an action packed story where your mind rarely wanders. And it was sweet :)",2
"Doesn't work.: It's possible that it may be my fault - I may have misidentified the kind of ants I have. But they will gather around it for a moment, and then march right past it without ever paying it attention again. So I cannot recommend this product, as it has not worked for me.",1
"It will Change your Life !!!: This book is a ""must have"" for anyone who wants to change your life and take control away from the ones who never call back, the ones who aren't quite honest, and the ones that you just need to avoid. If you keep losing at relationships, this book will change all that and make you a WINNER !!! The clear message that I got is to change myself, and the results I get will be different.",2
"NOTHING NEW!: the ""state"" belongs to the first days of the 90's, but what can i say we pased those days. not exciting, childish words and boring suond . i am so sorry that i bought this album from ... dont do the same mistake (unless you are a teenager! )",1
"What happened?: I wnet to a Toys r' us by me and i saw the X-box there so i tried out the controller. I literally started laughing. I began thinking ""how could they make a controller this bad after 100's of hours of testing""? First of all the joy stick is too far down making it hard for people with larger hands to play. And if you have small hands the handles are huge making your hands feel as if they are defective. The buttons are so close to each other its hard to hit them without accidently hitting another one. My personal opinion and most others is that Microsoft should never have entered the gaming industry. Im not so sure they know what ergonomics is or what the differences between computer games and console games are. If you want a specialized computer that only plays certain PC games go ahead and pick up an XBOX, but if your a console gamer head on over to GameCube or even PS2..... avoid Dreamcast that failed.",1
"Not recommended as of June 2005: I originally purchased this router in April. The original product on which this is based the DI-624 got excellent reviews. The 624M was supposed to be the same great product w/ MIMO support.Unfortunately, this is not the case with the original firmware. As mentioned in previous reviews, a new password would take several minutes to become active. The menu options would work intermittently, or not at all. The router would hang on several occassions. The ports would not stealth automatically as in the original DI-624.To top it all off, as of this writing, there hasn't been a single firmware upgrade/fix available on the D-Link support site to address these issues. This router has been available since at least January of 2005.I ended up returning this one, and purchasing the DI-624 instead. (No problems with that model at all.)",1
bedroom torchiere lamp: Great lamp. We've had it for a few months now. My son is able to read in bed and it's adjustable to his position in bed. Really like that it uses standard lightbulbs.,2
"SONY HD DVR vs. TIVO HD series 3: Well I had the SONY DVR but the software was pure junk. The TIVO user interface & capabilities are far superior, we would rather pay the monthly fee & get something highly usable than use the no fee SONY. I am a big SONY fan but this time I found out they cannot compete. On the SONY you cannot put in a keyword & have it record any show that contains that keyword, called WISH LIST in TIVO. If you record a repeating show week to week you cannot tell it to only save the last so many shows. TIVO has all of this & then some. The Internet connection makes upgrades easy for TIVO, no can do with SONY. So with TIVO it's either the old fashion fone line connection or an Internet connection.",1
"Awsome Show!!!: I have been watching ""Teen Wolf"" since the first episode aired on MTV. When I saw the previews I thought it might be a good show...I was not disappointed, this show has a great story line. What I like most about it is that each character is evolving, and all the good stuff isn't just focused on one character....I recommend this show to anyone, and yolu should also check out season 2 its great as well..I'm gonna purchase it as soon as its on DVD!!!",2
"Cute, but doesnt exactly look like the photo: Its cute, but i had to cut the hair the get the look in the photo. Bought it for my 2yo niece. Hope she loves it",2
"Dont Waster Your Money: This movie is so bad I could not even finish watching it. I dont even want to waste any more time writing about. Take my word for it, spend the $2.00 on anything else! I never write reviews but I could not wait to write this one!",1
"My face feels clean!: The 6oz. bottle goes a long way, I only use one squirt and it lathers up nicely. It will last for a long time.",2
"It's in His Kiss: I like smart, outspoken heroines, but Hyacinth got on my nerves. There is a time to be smart and outspoken but not when it makes everyone around you look idiotic and that is what the author seemed to do here. No-one seemed to be able to match wits with Hyacinth and I didn't want to read about her showing off her intelligence all the time. The twist at the end where she gets her come-uppence by her own daughter is cute.",1
Dissapointing lack of quality: Better knives can be had for less money at any grocery store. Can't believe wusthof would put their name on this junky set of knives.,1
"Almost a 5 star: I got my helmet in several days ago and have been welding with it now for 3 days. I didnt want to buy a 60 dollar helmet because i will relaistically only be welding ONE project that I can think of.... SO for the price I was expecting a thin plastic hunk of junk. Well I got way more than that. For the price it is exceptional.PROS:*CHEAP! The best Pro!*Blocks harmful rays*ValueCONS:*Side helmet bolt stripped when I was using it*Narrow viewing areaOverall I feel it is a 4.5 star, even with the issues I had. Totally worth it for me because I didnt want to throw down 60 bucks for something IM ONLY GOING TO USE ONCE!!!!!!Satisfied.",2
"Masterpiece by the Master!!: I have been a fan of Mc Stevie Hyper D since back in 97' when I heard him rip up the mic on a mixtape. Later on we all know he died in 98' from an undiagnosed heart condition. Mc Stevie was the top of his game. He left a gap in jungle music that will never be filled. This cd shows Mc Stevie's versatility on the mic, from mc'ing to actual singing. All these tracks have stood the test of time even though jungle changes so often as we all know. This cd ranges from ""rollers"" to ""two step"" to""jump-up"" to ""hip-hop jungle"". All the tracks feel fresh. So if you are a""tru junglist"" You should definately pic this one up. He shows why he was the best.R.I.P. Mc Stevie Hyper DIf you can find it pick it up because its rare.I had been looking for it for several years with no luck and when I would find it, was out of stock or they did not have it anymore. But I'm glad I was able to get my hands on a copy of this masterpiece. definately recomend it.Later",2
"Spiritual ramblings galore: Got this book as a gift and read a few pages in order to know what it's really about. Conclusion: it's not for me. Pages after pages of spiritual ramblings and open ended questions with nothing to add. Talks all the time about quantum physics and related concepts without having no real idea of what it really means and without making any effort for properly defining what exactly they are talking about. That's just an example of some of the open-ended questions and science ""buzzwords"" mentioned throughout this non-sense book.",1
"Large Pan! wonderful for those family meals: This is a great stainless pan with an encased bottom to provide good heat transfer. The primary handle stays cool to warm. The secondary handle does get a bit hot.I was looking for something larger than my other pans, and boy this one does it! I didn't realize at the time that this 14"" pan is giant. It crowds the surrounding burners, so if you want to run 3 or 4 things on the stove at once it is a bit difficult. However, the large size helps accommodate the larger portion sizes to feed a meal to 6-8 people!I wish it came with a matching lid...preferably glass.",2
"Best Westlake ever: This book is a total departure for Donald Westlake and one for the better. While the plot deals with the theft of a train load of coffee, the book is so far beyond an average hiest story that it is hard to catagorize. The setting, the characters - even the steamy sex scenes - are more than one expects after reading Westlake's other books. This is, in many ways, a serious novel, but at the same time, very entertaining. I had to read it in one long session. It was that gripping.",2
"Fast Delivery!: Had a slight bend in the back of the book, but not too much of a bother.Had really good shipping speed. :} All-in-all good condition.Appreciate it.",2
"I don't get it....: I can't connect with this author's style. It's like he has confused points of view. He's taken 3rd person omniscient and bled some of that omniscientism into the supporting cast of the protagonist (but leaving the protagonist unscathed by this external blessing of knowledge). What this means is that there is alot of internal dialogue by the protagonist with mysterious unsolocited answers by characters in the book that are taken for granted. Because they all (ok not all... a large portion) share this ""line-of-reasoning"" with the protagonist, it is hard to define the edges, boundaries, and distances between the different characters. It's still good enough to want to know how it ends, but the experience is not as fun as it should be.",1
Used not New / Plastic not metal: I thought this was a new product. I received two miss matched fans with different connectors and mounting configurations. The picture looked to be a metal housing but both fans were plastic. I will be returning the items.,1
"Jose: Coolaroo Elevated Pet Bed with Knitted Fabric, this bed is excellent quality the metal frame structure is well made and the fabric is very cool even in hot days here in California my dog loves it, he spend most of the day in it.I'm very please with this product. We have bought this product before and lasted 3 years which is excellent for what it cost.",2
Terrible: I was disappointed. The product was wrong for my old SEGA Genesis and it didn't have in the description which SEGA it goes to. I contacted AMAZON and never heard back from them nor the seller. I even mentioned that I was willing to exchange. I got ripped off and now stuck with the wrong AUX hookups.,1
"Intelligent. throught-provoking documentary: Understated, thoughtful documentary about different recent generations in America, andhow their politics and upbringings intermeshed and evolved.As a film student in 1969 Ralph Arylck made a 15 minute short about a bright 4 year oldboy who lived upstairs with hippie parents in Haight-Asbury. 4 year old Sean had tried pot,refused to wear shoes, etc.Now Arlyck sets out to find out what happened to Sean 30+ years later - was he a mess as somepredicted? Had his upbringing left him free as others hoped?Of course the answer is far more gray and complex. And inexamining Sean and his family, film-maker Arlyck also looks at his own.A quiet film, not deeply emotional, but a very interesting and worthy essay about parental ideals, family, and life.",2
I almost couldn't watch the whole thing.: I think there's a reason people don't make films centered around table tennis.,1
"Bad Decision: I was expecting a much better sound quality based on the manufacturer's name, the signal is poor. I am using it at 10 feet distance from the transmitter and there is a hiss on the background. If you adjust the tuning knob you can reduce the hiss but also reduce the volume and viceversa.This product seem to use old analog transmission, look for digital (Bluetooth) technology which pairs transmiter to receptor.Also, the pads gets your ears hot when using it at movie average time (1.5 hours)No good!",1
as usual good: the usual patter and snappy writing.....Lassiter at his best and I love how human the character is...a little conceited and sure of himself but screws up.......a lot of my Lassiter reviews bleed over into each other,2
"I can't relate to fantasty creatures. Well done but boring.: I don?t like fantasy. However, I?m a big movie buff. This trilogy has been a big box office success. And people whose opinion I trust have recommended that I see it.Well, the day finally came. And as I put this 3-hour epic into my DVD I was prepared to have an open mind.Yes, there were good special effects. And yes, the actors seemed adequate. But I hated the story. And, if it was supposed to be symbolic, it got lost on me.I just can?t relate to fantasy creatures. I don?t care about their problems. All I could do was look at the clock. Well, I lasted for 113 minutes. And I hated every one of those minutes.This is not a film for me. And I can?t recommend it.",1
"This saw is for lite trim work only! But has no box!: .One very usefull little trim saw! Worm drive works very well and seems to handle anything lite. You can not cut a 2x4 with this so don't buy it thinking you can.The only thing porter cable should have done with it is to have provided a box for it, It was designed way back in the 30's or 40's and to this date 2007, they still do not have a box???....A Shame!The saw is much to easy to break or bend if not placed in some kind of case when transporting it. The size of this saw makes it very hard to find just the right size as well....But we have to give the tool itself 5 star because it works very very well!A bit on the ""To high priced side"" with out a storage however!",2
"AWESOME, works GREAT: I have had very very very small problem with this pop filter. The only problem is that it seems that the pop filter itself is a little loose if you turn it the wrong way... but then when you twist hard onto the flexible attachment, it's totally fine. It's actually double filtered and the clamp allows me to just put my headphones because it works like one of those stand attachments too... GREAT POP FILTER FOR THE PRICE, NO REGRETS =).",2
BROKEN ON DELIVERY: My product was broken when it arrived. I will let the company know and keep you informed with their reply.,1
"Bleh...: I wouldn't recommend The Smurfs at all, it just isn't really that good of a movie. It isn't even decent. There are a couple funny parts, but those laughs only last for a second and then they're gone, leaving the whole rest of the movie boring and dull. This just isn't a good movie... -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare",1
"don't buy this: unless you've never read a book on nutrition, this is a waste of time. the content is poor and there is nothing that one couldn't find on the web.",1
"The real starting point for me!: This is the book that began everything I've ever learned about Chi and meditation! I have been training for ten years now! I initially picked it up because I wanted to learn the INTERNAL aspect my Kung Fu teacher(Sifu) hinted at as the true power behind the martial arts. I found it to be an amazing explaination of something intangible (chi) explained with real science by a PhD in Physics. Dr. Yang turned out to be one of the most sincere and highest level of expertise authors I could have ever hoped to find on the subject. I have read many other authors on the subject, which he (humbley) encourages you to also, and I still haven't found anything that connects with more substance and no fluff than Dr. Yang's. This is the perfect starting point for someone who may just want to find out if they could meditate and bring more depth to their natural hobbies and sports. Go For It!",2
"The Original Is always The Best Nevermind Remakes.: Too Cartoonish Indeed,To me part 1-5,(with 1 of course being the very best),2 being good,and 5 downright silly.represents the height of the freddy franchise. Wes Craven's New Nightmare was also good, If your like me who grew up on this franchise watching On WBFS-33, or wdzl-39(the most) then NO REMAKE w/o Englund will due.",1
"NERVE: The songs on this are worth 5 stars obviously. but i;d just likree to point out that EVERY song on this ep is available elsewhere. Either on the singles as B sides (Even in his youth-SLTS, D7 is on lithium (the version i got anyway), and the rest are pretty much all off of Incesticide. So there is nothing new here unless you are a completest collector whos buying it just to own it.",2
"Compact, stays sharp but not TSA compliant.: I've had the original folding Tweezerman clipper for years until it was confiscated post 9-11. Sadly the newer versions are not as well made as the original and are not made in Germany anymore.Still, these folding nail clippers are compact, maintain their edge and cleanly cut my nails with little effort. There is even a little ring on the end with which to hang off one's keychain. In addition, Tweezerman (a subsidiary of Zwilling Henckels) has an awesome lifetime guarantee and sharpening service on all their implements.For those that would like to travel by air, Tweezerman's parent company has this version, http://www.amazon.com/Pour-Homme-Clipper-Black-Leather/dp/B002A9JPKK/ref=pd_sim_bt_1 that does not have the fold-out nail file and is therefore TSA compliant.As this is a very compact nail clipper, those with larger hands may find it awkward to handle.",2
"Strange programming: I was disappointed in this product because the programming is strange. You can only program it to three preset temperatures: Vacation (55), Away/Asleep (62?), and home (70). During the day, there are 4 set temperature periods - Away/Asleep, Home, Away/Asleep, Home, and all you can do is choose the times during which those 4 periods will occur. You can't specify the temp, and if you don't want a period, you just make it as short as possible (15 min). So if you like to sleep at 68 degrees, and have your house at 72, you can't use the programming - You'll have to just manually change the temps.",1
A biography on ''The Famos dare devil'' Seth Enslow: If you are a dirt biker its a most see.From when he started to when he was simply amazing.See him jump his death difiing 249 foot jump witch leaves him with 50 stapls in his head.I strongly recomend this dirt biking biography.,2
"Not the Staheekum Scuff of Old: I used to buy these all the time & loved them ... then for a long while I could not find them, so when I found these I was very happy even though the price had gone up considerably Having had them for a while they are a big disappointment. The old Staheekum were snug fit. These have stretched out in the width as to make them unusable.... so if you are expecting what you use to get when you bought these... these are not the old quality Staheekum Scuff!",1
"Wiener Dog Art collection disappointing: Well I was expecting a full book of Weiner Dog Art. It's one hundred eleven (111) pages and only sixteen (16) of those have anything to do with the title of the book. The rest is all Gary Larson - Far Side, but not Weiner Art. Not good at all.",1
Fun book: This book was a hit in my class. I pokes fun at standardized testing in a way that the kids can understand and find humorous. It is great to read before major testing starts. It helps get past the serious nature of all the tests and helps the students relax. Cute story and the pictures are great.,2
"Best looking by far: Excellent product for the price. If you are short on space, this unit looks smart inside and out. The outside side panels are NOT stainless - they are gray, so if you're trying to keep a clean look that matches fridge/stove/etc, a cubby or nook to place it in would be best. I've actually had people exclaim out loud when the open it... the inside is gorgeous.This is my third Cuisinart product. My experience with customer service has been great, especially the man who ran the warehouse that my coffee maker parts came from. Send in your warranty card: if anything goes wrong you have a better chance of smooth dealings.",2
Fantastic: I am sitting hear listening to my new CD. I received it a number of months ago but have only now taken the time to listen..........and now how sorry I am not to have played it much earlier. This is one of the finest pieces of contempory/jazz CD's I have ever heard. A must for anyone serious about their music.,2
"It even worked on my thick, curly hair: I was looking for a gentle, yet absorbent towel and this is it. I put this towel on my head and my hair is dry in about an hour, a great improvement from the hours it usually takes for my hair go air dry. I am trying to protect my hair from heat and this gas turned out to be the perfect tool. Towel was packaged well. I think I will pick up another one of these for my mother.",2
"Excellent Book: I will be keeping this book as a resource for a long time. After reading a few chapters, it fired me up and I couldn't wait to try out some of the suggestions. I love that it breaks down the writing process and makes plot development something that can be done in manageable steps.",2
"Could be better...: I loved this CD, and it was well worth the price (Hey, I've never seen it cheaper) But in my opinion, it was missing something, perhaps if the company had added somemore songs? Anyways, WELL WORTH THE MONEY! I listen to it over and over (Bugs everyone ^_^) So, if your a hard-core digi-fan, get it.",2
Honest and Eye Opening.: Often when one has tunnel vision you miss the scenery. Normal hardworking Americans are now scenery to a liberal end mission.,2
Tori!: This CD is a must own. All the old Tori fans will love it because it gives you new songs you dont own already and all the new fans will love it because it gives them a taste of all of her old CD's. It also comes with a bonus DVD because Tori loves to give more to her fans.,2
"Adequate performance, few replacement parts available: I bought this 120 volt welder for my son 3 years ago. It performed well an average of 20 times a week welding light materials in a motorcycle customizing shop. After 2 years the torch head began having problems and performance declined. It became unusable recently and I tried to get replacement parts. Clarke is out of business now and some parts, including the torch assembly we need, are not to be found. My son had to get a new comparable welder (Lincoln) and is quite happy.",1
"Call of Duty 4: After pondering the thought of buying an Xbox 360 just for CoD 4, I went out and got one (with CoD 4 of course)and I must say it is amazing. I'm normally not a graphics kinda guy but CoD 4's graphics are astounding. Everything from the junk on a desk to the explosions from an RPG. The game controls with ease. The smooth movements makes scoring headshots a breeze. I am pretty much impressed with every single aspect of this game. I have yet to dive into multiplayer just yet but I can only imagine it being better. Infinity Ward did a great job of putting CoD back on top of the FPS list. Kudos.",2
"Good for the money.....: I bought this unit a few months ago......With HD sat. service it looks great!! The one let down being that this model does not have HDMI input, but other that that Video games in 1080I look amazing.....great buy",2
"gladly it's not too religiously pested: i watched the movie and thoroughly enjoyed it even it was a lukewarm movie with a very slow pace. the movie itself showed the state of georgia like a vacuumed bubble without anything but courtroom, almost empty prison, beautiful scenery, nice lawns and houses, even the cemetery looked nice, not too much traffic or too many pedestrians. i also found out that there was not too much propaganda of the christian stuff putting everything related to god, and that's really good.",2
"i can't even believe this book: how disturbing. this book reflects contemporary american society's obsession and reverence for the rich, money, and materialism. the advice this book offers will only fuel the corrupt system that is operating today (a system which is udoubtedly in a downward spiral). do yourself a favor and be one of the few people who is not obsessed with ""making it to the top.""",1
I would not recommend.: This thing is terrible. I love the looks of it but it is a piece of junk. The base is to narrow so it tips over all the time if you dont wedge it up against the front seat. My child does not fit in it anymore and he is only 3 months old. He weighs 16 lbs and the straps are to tight. (I even took it to the fire station to make sure I was not doing something wrong) Last but not least while I am carrying the car seat around the screws just keep falling out of the handle no matter how tightly we screw them in. Absolute piece of junk.,1
"Ahhhhh: Well, at first I bought a X Brand FM Transmitter really cheap , the Seller sent me a non working one and 4 weeks later I got my money back.Then I did a lot of research and this looks to me like the best option given the reviews and I went for it. I live in Miami and in my Rover it did not work that great. I still have a LOT and I mean A LOT of interference. So probably in your car could work in mine definitely do not.",1
"Waste of my Time!: In my opinion, this book lacked plot and an interesting storyline. It skipped around from character to character and lacked in all areas. Very depressing stories for each character. It took me 3-4 weeks to finish this book. Normally I will not put something down until I'm finished. Skip It.",1
"Natural Cures ""They "" Don't Want You To Know About.: This writer(?) should be banned from TV! A waste of money. My grandmother could have told me more and better and helpful advice!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"Yes, the title is eventually explained in the book!: Quick synopsis: Clare and her brother Rob are in a car accident. Rob is killed and his arm is stolen. A true crime writer contacts Clare because he believes he knows who stole her brother's arm and he wants her help in tracking down the macabre thief. Okay, well maybe that is an overly concise version of the plot, but you get the picture.I think it's shame this book is out of print. I really enjoyed it. I loved the bleakness of it all because I felt that it enhanced the story and helped to set its mood. I thought the juxtaposition of the horror of the events with the blandness of the setting made those events seem even more horrific.",2
"This is a joke-book!: Avoid it; anyone who buys this book is financing a anti-India, socialist looby.Author is well-known for her twisted take on anything Indian.",1
Dyson Floor Tool Attachment: The Dyson low-reach floor tool attachment I ordered worked great. It fit my Dyson DC14 and was shipped to me as promised.,2
Tripe by any other name . . .: One more bitter uber-conservative hack mad at the world because others can think.,1
"Works great!: I've never had a holder that wrapped around, and I really like it. It was very inexpensive but doesn't look cheap. I'd recommend it!",2
"intelligent vulgarity: I've never seen a movie get so many one stars and five stars. It's a one joke movie and you have to buy into the joke that a Teddy Bear that comes to life would also grow up; and everyone around Ted accepts it as normal. He smokes pot, chases women, drives a car, gets a job... Yes it is R/Unrated but it is not a gross out comedy like so many other R-rated ones seem to go for. It was a pretty thin year for comedies and I thought this was easily one of the best of the year.",2
"Terrible: I rented this movie on pay-per-view on a Friday night when I was really in the mood for something scary. Not only was it not scary, it was boring. And enough we the meowing kid! The kid and the cat were killed in the same tragic accident but I don't understand how they merged into one. Or why the kid was wearing eyeliner. Don't waste your money on this movie.",1
"They Look Horrible After a few Washes: I ordered 5 pairs of these for my husband because he loves Tommy Hilfiger pants, but was disappointed when I got them and realized they were the wrinkle resistant fabric. We returned these to Costco after washing them because the fabric looks pilly and old once washed (hung to dry) a few times. The price is right, but they are not the usual Tommy quality.",1
"Listen to the smell: During a night on the town, while seeing the midnight cowboys and getting more and more bent (that means old) my friends and I shared a few laughs over the poem ""A Cat Named Sloopy."" Someone in the back seat brought up the subject of bad poetry and a couple of us instantly thought of Rod McKuen. My girlfriend kept an old copy of ""Sloopy"" stashed in the glove box. I almost crashed her sedan as she read aloud the first lines of ""Sloopy"".McKuen's writing style, a strange combination of self love and bombast, mixed with bad grammar and awkward metaphors, will ever serve young poets as an example of how not to write free verse. I always chuckle when I hear the line ""my arms full of canned liver and love."" You say potato, and I'll say poetaster. Let's call the whole thing off.",1
"Psycho light: This flick was compared to Descent, which is a great outing into the horror genera. This is nothing like that. The first thing you have to do with this DVD, is to go into the set up menu and turn on the English, and now you have a dialogue spoken in Norwegian with English dubbed in. Hard to watch. Add to that the vocal music and text shown in newspaper articles is all in Norwegian, this leaves an English viewer out of the loop. That behind us, this storyline is standard fare, the actors do a great job, the leading lady is a take charge likable character. In the horror genera, I think the bar has been raised quite a bit above this production. Yes it has it's moments, of suspense, but it doesn't quite make the grade of a modern slasher film. I don't want gore for the sake of gore, such as Saw, but this one seems to go out of the way not to offend anyone. I'm just glad I didn't pay the new release price.",1
Great Blender: I really like this blender. It is so much quieter than my previous blender and does an excellent job blending my smoothies and protein shakes.,2
"never never never: Sorry Amazon - if you want to create a new market, you can't engage in Orwellian business practices. You've just killed the entire category for automatic book downloads. Maybe if I can get a model that syncs to my computer, I'll reconsider in the future - but not from Amazon.",1
"Not as Well Crafted...: I loved Perdido Street Station, and thought the Scar was quite good, but this one is a real slog. There's very little suspense, and it seems more like a musing rumination than a novel. I sure hope his next will be better.",1
"I see why people RAVE over early Stewart material!: I decided to pick this up on remastered CD and I have to admit, this collection of early Rod Stewart material is simply rocking. I finally see what people are talking about when they RAVE about Rod's early material and how it reaches and touches them inside. So much soul and rock this guy has inside of him I just don't see any current artist doing this depth of work today. The track, ""Oh No not My Baby"" is worthy of buying this album alone.",2
Dickens?: I have read a lot of Dickens and thought I would enjoy these stories. They seem unfinished and lack detail.,1
ActiveEpi CD: This is an excellent introductory tool for basic epidemiology. The video presentations are great and can be replayed for learning enhancement. The quizes are helpful and target the exact information.,2
"Cute dress but could be better: I bought this dress for a program my daughter was having at school. It was cute and served the purpose but was not put together well. The seams were open where the material around hoops met, only tacked at ends to hold together. The shaw around the top of hat was not tacked and flipped from front to back so I had to tack it to the front myself. Before the program started my daughter stepped on the bottom of her dress once and the bottom border of the dress ripped. I had to sew it back on that night so she could wear it again for the program the following day.",1
"Good Mystery!!: Having read all of Tamara Hayle's mysteries and enjoyed them! I can happily say that I enjoyed Easier To Kill! Once again my girl got the job done! I was hopping that myabe there would be a little romance for Tamara, but it wasn't to be. Perhaps in the next book.",2
Number 1 Fan: I have to say that this book was very informative and told me loads of things about Alanis that i though i already knew. This is a must have for any fan as you get to understand Alanis as a normal person rather than just another million selling artist. This book shows that Alnais is true and as devoted to her life as we are to her,2

"Blu-ray Cutting Edge - do not buy: Do not buy this Blu-ray. The quality is horrible and totally unacceptable - full of snow. The non-Blu-ray version is a 1,000% better quality.",1
Priceless: This is an outstanding collection for anyone who is fascinated and moved by the life of St. Therese. The written documentations that accompanied the pictures give even greater insight into her daily life as a Carmelite nun. This book is a treasure.,2
"Good but something missing...: I've loved the Cure since about 1984...I love the haunting melodies and Robert's ballads, like This Twilight Garden, Apart, Catch...this CD is good but I guess I was just hoping for more of these types of songs like A Letter to Elise or Trust...",2
Great Stool: We received the stool and my auntie is very pleased with it - it really helps with her bathing (along with the bars we installed). Thank you.,2
mmmm yummy!: mmm! I smelled this on my friend and had to ask him to loan it to my husband! yummmmmmm! And then I had to buy it for my hubs. It's a very sexy and inviting scent. mmmmm!,2
Doesn't light...at all!: I bought a lighter from this manufacturer about a year ago and was pleased with its price and performance. This time around I got the more expensive version because I wanted a bit more longevity from the thing and I needed a spare (I'm always losing stuff like this). I'm very disappointed with this lighter. It barely lights and is completely useless. I've adjusted and filled and cleaned... all to no avail. There's obviously a quality control problem so I would urge you to stay away from this one.,1
"Even the sun would dance...: I have listened to this CD many times, I love many of these songs; they have all stirred by heart. I feel Donna Long has captured the spirit of these Hafiz poems to such an extent that if the sun had feet they could not resist clicking their heels together, and saying ""Hey earth kids, something great is here, grab your Sony and headphones and dance - leap and whirl with me!!!Daniel Ladinsky, author/translator of: The Gift, Poems by Hafiz, 1999 Penguin USA.",2
"a pep talk: After a decade of growing anti-Semitism, some Jews seem more willing then ever to retreat from the secular and non-Jewish world. Sacks's book is a ringing rebuttal to this view, quoting a variety of Jewish sources. For example, he quotes the Talmud: ""for the sake of peace, the poor of the heathens shall be supported as we support the poor of Israel...""By and large, this is not the sort of book that imparts new information so much as the sort of book that tells us what we already know- a kind of pep-talk for burnt-out, bummed-out Jews. I liked it, but thought it was a bit too long for its message.",2
"Kind of weird, kind of long, kind of boring but still...: I had to read some parts of this book for class and there were times when I was so confused by the writing that I had to reread parts three or four times. At other times I had no problem understanding what was going on. Overall, it is an enjoyable read if you are interested in how biographies were written in the middle ages and if you don't take every word seriously since the author wasn't very faithful to history.",2
"Snorefest: To predictable and to utterly stupid to get any higher, but still it wouldn't make the top 100 worst movies ever made. It is very bad, and you already know the plot. A beast of some sort terrorizes and kills a few people, and team set's out to investigate what did the killings, they meet the beast, they run around and scream for 45 minutes and magically defeat the beast at the end, and everyone lives happily ever after. Typical monster movie schlock. I suggest seeing something else, cuz I can't really find any redeeming qualities about this reched movie!",1
"I Don't Care for Elvis, But I Like Lisa Marie: I grew up worshiping Big Mama Thornton... In Benton Harbor, MI. So... I Hate Rednecks, & I don't listen to Elvis. I'll cop to the fact that he was charismatic and talented, but I think his daughter is better than he was. My money says ten years from now lots of people will agree with me, so put your money down!",2
"NOT A COOLER: As pointed out by many other reviews here, the product does not cool. Well, maybe 1 or 2 degrees. But it is more like a humidifier rather than a cooler.Very disappointed, will look into returning it if not too late.",1
"Love the glove!: At first, I was having trouble with the foam ""stay"" slipping out of the channel on the back of the glove, but I solved this problem by simply folding over the glove about 1/2"" (you'll understand this better when you have the glove on). Also, the beanbag-like palm pad seemed as though it was going to be too bulky, but I've grown to really like it: it serves to curve the palm into a very restful, relaxed position. I find that I can do most anything with the glove on, too.",2
Blade and disc holder: Great holder. Should be a little larger to hold all of the blades I want to purchase.,2
"Book written by a fanatic with a personal vendetta: This book claims it is a true account, and the fact of the matter is that it is amply distorted by adding false facts in order to accomplish the author's desire to push her religious beliefs to the reader. I believe that any author who deceives her readers in order to push a personal vendetta should be penalized, no matter if she is right or wrong. I assume that through this book she wants to scare those who are tempted to become Satanists, druggies, etc, but I wonder what her religion has to say about tricking people into being close to God? This book is terrifying, and shockingly enough it is supposed to be for kids; in my opinion, it harms a teenager's mind, rather than accomplishing anything else. I wonder how many teenagers have been traumatized by this book. It is definitely not a read for someone who does not have formed criteria.",1
"The reality: I'm giving up on these things...As many others have noted, they only last a couple of years, not 5 years as stated. The problem is you can't turn these things on and off like you do a normal bulb. So if you put them in a bathroom for example where you do this several times though out the day, it shortens the life.Also, if the bulbs put out a very yellow light and are not the same as a ""60 watt"" bulb. You can confirm this with any camera light meter. The ""Daylight"" bulb that is rated at 6500K is a nice white bulb, brightness is improved a bit as well... but they cost more.If you have a location where you need to walk in at 9AM, turn the lights on, then turn them off at 9PM, and don't care about how yellow things look, then these may be just the ticket. But the reality is for home use, most bulbs are turned on and off several times a day and these bulbs can't handle it. Any minor energy savings is offset by cost of the bulb.Only use these in lights that stay on for hours at a time.",1
"Awesome!!! Preview Disc: First of congrats to Nintendo, The preview disc is the best disc that Nintendo has come out with. It has great demos and movies of the years best upcoming games. To anyone who does not have a gamecube yet, I recommend that u purchase one and u get the preview disc for free, its a great deal and its worth itPlus it has a bonus demo of the most hottest game coming out this year SOUL CALIBUR II!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2
"What happened to Eric?: What happened to EC? Ill tell you what happened he lost hisMOJO. He made enough money to buy his soul back from the Devilat the crossroads. Truth is in his old age he just doesnt have it anymore. What turned all of us on when we were young is no-where to be found on this CD or for that matter the last few.I think he still has it in him ( CONCERET FOR GEORGE )but thisCD lacks the passion were used to from EC. If you have liked his last few CDs you might enjoy this, but if your a long time fanlooking for that old flame I highly do not recommend this CD.",1
"Fresh and believable: I have to admit to reading Festival a few years ago, so this is not a recent read for me. But that should say something about it's memorability factor. I came across the book while looking for another here on Amazon and was immediately reminded of how much I loved Festival. There are so many fresh elements to this romance. For example, the hero and heroine fall in love before they ever meet face to face. Telephone calls...sexy telephone calls, allow them to get to know one another and enjoy each other's good qualities before physical factors come into play (What a nice change!!)A time-travel and romance saga is the best description for Festival. I highly recommend it.",2
Bad: The Voyger Series Cd's are just bad. I would never buy another one. There is more to select from at amazon.,1
"I didn't like at all.: Here is what I think about the taste, it's really bad. I did follow the instructions, it's not something you will enjoy eating specially if you like eating beans. Here is the problem making it the beans become really soft while the rice are still hard, and the soup takes on a weak style bean soup. I didn't like it at all.",1
"Doesn't help hip pain: I bought this thinking it would alleviate my hip pain from the extra weight of the baby but it didn't. Instead, I woke up with a crick in my neck in addition to pain in my hip (the snoogle is hard and a little too large for me to use as a pillow). So I went to Target and bought an egg-crate foam mattress for $12 to put over our usual mattress - it works great! No hip pain, no cricks in the neck!",1
"Great little camera: I love my camera and I love that it takes movies too...I just wish it had a stronger zoom or at least some available adapters for a stronger zoom for my bird photos! But other than that, I have enjoyed it tremendously and get great photos out of it.",2
For everyone--no matter their movie tastes.: I love this movie. I have yet to find a person who did not enjoy it. Even those who are hesitant to watch foreign films have raved about how wonderful it is. It is rare to find a movie that so many people with so many different tastes enjoy.,2
"Impossibly boring: This book starts out in an interesting fashion. Unfortunately, it quickly becomes a mire of dysfunctional people caught up in unbelievable situations. While the story line could have some potential, and the historical line should be interesting and exciting, it does not come together to be a good evening read.",1
"Dissapointment: I have worn Easy Sirit shoes and they had a perfect fit. This time, the same size, 6M did not fit, they were too tight.When I ordered my shoes, I looked inside my old shoes to find the size, I ordered the same size and was really dissapointed when they arrived.They looked beautiful, just what I was looking for, but not a good fit.",1
"Short, fun, and just challenging enough for a newbie: I am pretty terrible at computer games, preferring to stick with ones that do not need need coordination, but rely on logic. While this game lacks some of the more challenging puzzles I have found elsewhere, it is a fun romp through exotic settings, involves some interesting films, and gave me a good 3 days of wandering in its world.This one won't keep you busy for too long, but for the price, you'll get more than what you paid for!",2
"great movie: it's a bit old, but it is timeless. the first time I saw it, I liked the hate, but this last time I saw it I saw the meaning and cried.",2
"A Good Start: For anyone who has not yet had an experience in their lives that gave them a deeper understanding of the world around them, this book is a good place to begin. Although the insights that are covered are not a complete explanation of the world around us, it does give us a glimpse at the underlying nature of the universe. At the very least this book will make you think. It will make you question what you have been taught. The conclusions reached in the various insights are hard to deny. After reading this book I felt relief that someone had finally wrote about this kind of explanation of spirituality.",2
"Very bad deal: Totally does not worth even $1. Very bad manufacturing. Two of the twelve ""S"" shaped pieces on the face fall the fist day I use it. of course I can't find spare ones anywhere. Also this 40 days issue is real, after day 31 you get day 32, 33 all the way to 39. You have to adjust it every month.",1
"On the whole, a remarkable album: Eliane gives us a sample of her perceptions of the music of both Latin America and North America, forming a cohesive and interesting whole. I'm a bit biased because I'm in love with her voice, but the instrumentals really aren't ALL consistent--thus the 4 stars. The best tracks are by far the 2 vocal Jobim renditions of ""Brigas, Nunca Mais"" and perhaps my favorite Jobim tune of all ""Chega de Saudade"". These 2 songs alone make the album worth buying; they are at once seductive, subtle, and sublime. They capture the essence of bossa nova without sounding retrograde. The first track is also a wonderful treat, signifying to me the joy of awakening to a new day, a new era, a new love.",2
Go ahead! Buy it!!!!!: I bought the Panasonic Nose and Hair trimmer for my son and do not regret! On the contrary! We are very pleased because this product serves as a proof of excellent brand-name product!,2
Love this show!!: I agree with a previous rater. There is a plethora of reality shows (too many) and it is great that CBS has produced something other than one of those here. It is wonderful to have a show that has intrigue and suspense. The introduction of some of the famous bits of the original Sherlock Holmes keeps the thread of that character intact. I hope they continue to produce this series.,2
"A great tool to change your life's path: This book presents many tools that require the reader to engage in valuable introspection. I believe many of us go on autopilot in our careers without thinking about how we got there, if that's the right place to be, and how to find the right place if it is not. We spend so much time at work but how much time do we spend charting our course?I have recommended this book to many people. The book is only as good as the energy you put into doing its exercises. Change and advancement requires work.",2
"Inspiration: I want to thank Susanna Tamaro because she had inspired me to become an author for I have way better stories to tell! Great writer, very simple and I do agree has many in-depth life lessons; however, I have lived through more tragic and life growing experiences.",1
"Rod Lost It After ""Every Picture tells A Story"": We all grow older and our taste's do change, I do like Billy Holiday,Louis Armstrong etc. but with Rod he lost it 35 years ago and only made one significant comeback that was with Jeff Beck doing ""People Get Ready"" beyond that Rod has not used his sandpaper voice for what it is intended ""BLUES/ROCK"". So Rod unless you want to team up with the remaining members of the Faces or Jeff Beck count me out. Beside's all of this the oringinals songs sound better even with poorer recording quality but you have to except that because most of these songs were originally done in the thirties and forties.",1
"Discouring start for a Bellydance beginner: Not worth your money. This is the first tape I purchased and I plan on selling on Ebay, if anyone will actually buy it. This is not a tape for beginners. When learning a move they will concentrate on a close up of her face and you can't learn the moves. I kept yelling ""Zoom Out"" please! I was completely discouraged after 15 minutes. I think I will try Veena and Nina (or whatever) instead!!",1
"An Unexpected Pleasure: I was fortunate to meet the author by accident at Pickett's Charge, Gettysburg, and I purchased my autographed book for emotional reasons. I was glad to have given in to them. The book is a gem on many accounts. For the Civil War enthusiast, who doesn't need the background, the non artillery information is placed in appendices in the back. The artillery information is concisely placed in seven chapters, and it is quite easy and interesting to read. It would make an excellent handbook for any teacher of the Civil War, who would love a hands-on approach to how the battles were fought and won/lost; and of course, a must-read for any Gettysburg enthusiast of whom I am one. An absolute delightful read. Colleen Bognet - Foreign Language Teacher/History Day Advisor - Hazleton Area School District",2
"Per favore, this is not music for an Italian wedding reception!: My husband and I spent quite a bit of money buying CDs with Italian Wedding in the title, hoping to make our wedding reception a joyous salute to our mutual Italian American heritage. We spent almost $25 for this CD, which had NOTHING we could really use in our Italian wedding, except for maybe one song during the ceremony in the church (but we had an organist for that) This is NOT a CD for an Italian wedding reception. In a way, the title is deceiving. Amore couple in Tampa",1
"Disappointed Lego Fan: My 9 & 6 year-old sons received this set for Christmas. They played with it for about 10 minutes. It is now under the bed. We are huge LEGO fans, but we are very disappointed with this set. The boys find it boring. It is also hard to store once set up.",1
"The worst season of the series: Well, this is by far the worst season of the series and possibly the reason why the show lost so much of its fans. They try to reuse ideas that worked for season 1 and the second time around it seems old and boring. Personally, the character of marissa becomes extremely annoying and the series arc is dissapointing. But if you're an OC fan like me you'll probably still end up buying this season",1
"Heavy reading, but worth it: For anyone who seeks to live a more spiritual life, to evolve their soul on the path to the one, I'd recommend you read The Twelve Blessings. You need to keep an open mind and let the knowledge pour in like a shaft of white light. When you do, you will understand why we are here in this life in this dimension.",2
"No Date: Of all the reviews here, everyone forgot to mention one key issue...THERE IS NOT A WAY TO GET THE CURRENT DATE TO SHOW ON THE FRONT DISPLAY SCREEN, OR THE INNER SCREEN. This has to be the only phone that does not show the date along with the time. I never would have purchased this phone had I known this. The only way to check the date is to go into the setup menu and view it along with the time. I can't believe this phone was actually designed like this. Other issues, the picture quality is horrible. I wouldn't expect great pictures from a camera phone, but the pictures this thing takes are useless. Also, the volume control on the side of the phone stopped working after two months. You would think with Motorola's name on it the quality of this thing would be much better. With this said, I will never buy a Motorola product again.",1
"Great Bag!: This is a great Camera Bag. I carried with me in Hawaii. it holds my three lenses and Canon Rebel XSi perfectly. easy access! durable, and fairly light. it was a great Buy!",2
"The songs that got away.: Cher is one of the great pop voices of the past four decades, but there were many career lows along the way, and this was one of them. She struggles valiantly through some of the most overblown arrangements of standards ever put down on vinyl, as if a great voice simply singing great songs wouldn't have been enough. The splendid ""Way of Love"" is tacked on to the end, but it's too little too late. (There's a classic typo in the new liner notes, too - ""It's worth noting..."" somehow became ""It's worth nothing..."", and that pretty well sums it up.)",1
"Misleading Listing: The songs are fine, but the listing shows CDG while the detail shows audio disc. Since there are no on screen prompts (CDG format), its not much good for Karaoke?",1
"Every American should own this book: The author is as gifted a writer as he is a photographer. His eloquent narrative will keep you on the edge of your seat, while his photographs will amaze you. You will enjoy this book whether you are a patriot, naturalist, environmentalist, sportsman, photography buff, writer, adventurer, or couch potato. Every American should own this book.",2
"Offensive: The Hard Ride is a fitting title for this book. It is apparent that the author has been to ""hell"" and back. Her book is filled with opinions of life, good, bad, and EXTREMELY offensive. She will certainly get your blood flowing. I read this book as a dare, from a friend who thought it was great, but has very different taste than I do. I can honestly say, I was offended by much of it, but my friends who have read it really enjoyed it. I guess it is art, and art is subjective... Read it at your own risk.",2

Bad Sound on DTS HD 5.1: Don't buy this version for the sound. The original track was monaural and this version has added a poorly done 5.1 track. If you have a surround sound system be sure to select the original track and let your system upgrade it.,2
"reference to: Crashed my Windows XP Pro, March 12, 2005: Same thing occurred to me - I have a Dell 8400 running XPPro SP2 and an external USB Maxtor HDD - I was using all six USB ports that came with the Dell machine, however when I added the Belkin F5U237 Hub everything worked okay until I rebooted it - than Nothing but grief!!!!! I exchanged the Hub in hopes it was a defective as I really liked the two top plug in ports - same thing occured with the replacement - after some experimenting I removed all the USB connections from my machine (i.e. MS Ofc keyboard, Maxtor external USB HDD, Video Camera, Laser PRN, Inteli-Mouse, Linksys USB Wireless Adapter) and just plugged the F5U237 Belkin Hub into the Dell Machine - guess what? it worked as advertised - however I now have 5 USB ports I can't use - so the only thing I gained is the convinience of top loading ports for my two 1GB Scan Crusers -",1
"It's Batman!: Surely you know who Batman is. Then you know he is the second most recognized American hero next to Superman. Batman was the next big success in DC's comic to film genre. Marvel is only now beginning to realize the potential in the mainstream comic to film genre. There are a lot of films around that originate in comics that no one knows about (e.g. From Hell). Spiderman was a great film for 2002, Daredevil is expected to do well, and Hellboy is in the making. If you liked or look forward to any of these, then you must own Batman. If you have not seen it, come out from hiding. Acknowledge that geniuses have made an incredible machine that allows people to views great stories on a screen. And then find a means to experiencing this film. Five out of five stars.",2
"SO MANY HITS, SO LITTLE TIME: Anyone who is at least 18 and says they have never rocked out to a Def Leppard song lives a sad sad existence. One of the most unappreciated rock bands of all time, they are one of only 5 real bands (no boy bands ) to have two records sell over 10 million copies, and have two other records over 7 million...neadless to say thats alot of hits...this album does justice by having alot of the hits from the ablums of the 80's, a few of high and dry, one of there most underrated ablums...they also have some songs off of slang, there most underrated ablum...and even gave papersun a call out, there best song from euphoria...the new cover of NO matter What is good, i recommend checking out Waterloo sunset, there cover from the International release they released earlier this year...to sum it up, this cd is great....LONG LIVE DEF LEPPARD",2

"A Waste of Money: I bought this from Amazon back in 2001 and it's been sitting in the garage since 2002. While it looks nice, all it's useful for is allowing water to stagnate in a pool at the base. It has a small, difficult-to-clean drawer one is supposed to use for oldcoffee grounds, but it is too small for this. Save your money and keep your machine on the counter, where it can be easily used and properly cleaned and refilled with water.",1
"rip off??: What I received was not the paperback full version of 90 Minutes in Heaven but a ""hardback"" with a few selections in large type!",1
Worth the Price: Thi book will certainly open your eyes and what to look out for. Especially if you are planning to build from ground up. I am into remodeling older homes but nevertheless good knowledge.,2
"good foundation but difficult to follow moves: i think terence dunn does a great job in taking his time to explain each move; however, the warmup is incredibly long and the visual angle/frontal view is extremely confusing for someone who is watching and trying to learn the moves..it's not a mirror image..i was left feeling frustrated instead of relaxed..",1
"had to have it: Corny, but one of those old movies that's fun to watch. No bad language, no blood and guts shown. Scary for kids, they may never eat jello again.",2
"Enjoyable time all the time: I personally got addicted to DC2. Excellent images, textures and backgrounds. We the intro started i got chills. I love it.",2
"Not so bad at all: ""The Darcys"" are much better than most of the sequels I read. The author doesn't idealize Darcy and Lizzy and it is very refreshing. Her Lizzy isn't ""inherently maternal"" and has no real problems with the birth of the first child (btw, the daughter) and even with the double standards of the age. Her Darcy isn't a paragon of virtue. And Bingley too. Of course, some dialogues are too long and the idea of Her Highness Caroline is too revolting but as a whole the story is not so bad. The author tries to be true to the Regency's mores and prejudices.",2
"Pretender is a must have!: I have all of the ""Pretender"" collection...and like the previous 3, season 4 was/is just as intriguing. If you don't own it, you should...especially if you're a fan of the show. My only regret, is that there won't be more...unless I'm mistaken, this was the final season. Too bad all the really great shows are cast aside.",2
recommended: We haven't used this item yet but it was highly recommended by several people we know who are tennis lovers...based on so many of their opinions we are forwarding on the 5 star recommendation,2
"could have been better: my class is using this book as the primary book. I have found that the explainations are often very wordy when they can be put very simply. So far the book has been using essentially one running example, i think this is one of the weaknesses in the book. also i have found that the excercises do not necessarily reflect the examples in the text. could be better.",1
Lowest Cost and Service: They are cheap we have them for our business. Their customer service for business customer is the worst. They will keep you on hold while your business phone do not work for 40 and 50 minutes. You get what you pay for. Be prepared even with a T-1 line to have to unplug your phone to get a decent connection. If I could afford better I'd go elsewhere. I use Vonage at home with no issues,1
"Had to modify it: This was supposed to fit a 2cm bar, but it was very loose, even with the extra padding. I had to drill a hole in the back and put in a self threading screw to keep it stable. Other than that, I'm happy",2
NOT A GOOD DEALER: I DO NOT SUGGEST DOING BUSINESS WITH THIS PERSON. NEVER GOT MY PRODUCT AND SENT SEVERAL MESSAGES AND GOT NO RESPONSE. I HAD TO GO THROUGH AMAZON TO GET MY MONEY BACK.,1
"Just Awful: Don't waste your time or money. At the beginning I kept thinking it would get better, but it didn't. It was painful and tedious to watch. Brad and George should never have agreed to do this film, they both acted overly incompetent and ignorant. Just a lot of disjointed scenes with a few funny moments. ""Burn before watching!""",1
"Action and twists...: Great story writing talent; not just at the level of ""an adventure"", but at the deeper level of what drives people to do what they do in a setting most people can but imagine (the life of ""the middle ages""). Melodramatic in places, and a tad bloodthirsty (no private read for a very young teen), but not gory (and zero sexual details, so you are safe with young teens reading it). Plot well-woven, in the sense of intersecting braids of characters that appear then re-appear... but not so convoluted that you need ""dog-earred"" pages, or re-reading to remember the details and nuances that are alluded to or referred to later in the series.A great tale and a great tale spinner.",2
"After listening You Will Understand what it's all about.: Just Buy It People. If You Like Music ( Good Quality Music , And Not Shitty MTV Music ) , Buy It. Black Will Make You Cry Like A Litlle Kid.

"Bleached Gospel: Let's be truthful, the Word is a bunch white boys, (okay they're not all white and color doesn't really matter, BUT ...)trying to sound soulful, but the soul is missing. Robert Randolph is definitely an able player who was brought up in the church and knows how to ""evoke the spirit,"" but if you want to hear the UNDISPUTED MASTERS OF SACRED STEEL, THE CAMPBELL BROTHERS ARE THE REAL DEAL. Just ask the Word band members on this CD, they too will acknowledge that they are neophytes when it comes to church/gospel music. The playing is good, but you can't fake soul and this ain't got much...lots of good notes, but not a lot of passion and soul behind them.",1
"Awesome album: I had no idea who Rilo Kiley was until I herd ""Portions for Foxes"" on the radio. I'm not a long time member of their fan club or been following them ""before they were somebody"". That being said, I love this album! Every song is not perfect but I just find it difficult to take out of my CD player. I when I do switch to listen to my IPOD via iTrip, I find myself going to RK on my playlists. The first three songs could all be singles (two are, in fact - ""It's a Hit"" and ""Portions for Foxes"", the other: ""Does he love you?"") and I have no problem listening to them over and over. ""I Never"" is also a highlight. A man/me/then jim is kinda slow but really solid. ""More adventurous"" is the title track and has some great lyrics. I really am in love with Jenny Lewis' voice and the rest of her isn't so bad either. Good stuff.",2
Excellent book: Definitely satisfied. Hardly no writing in this book and the writing that is there is done is pencil so it can easily be erased. I saved so much money on books for school. Will definitely order books from here again.,2
Healthy Coat: This stuff is great for my dogs fur - maintains a healhy glow like when she was a puppy - thanks,2
"awful movie: Casa De Mi Padre movie is not funny, actors are not professional, feels very long, the prop jokes are not funny.",1
"Negative: The polish was very thin and did not give the coverage that OPI is known to have. Also, my hand brushed the bottle and it rolled from the vanity into the sink and broke. It was not a long way from the vanity to the sink and the bathroom sink is not deep. I own other OPI polishes and this new one did not compare favorably. I have not used this vendor before and do not recommend.",1
The worst film I've ever seen.: After about an hour into this film I asked my friend if we could leave. He wanted to stay because we'd already paid for the tickets. I told him that I didn't care taht I would want these couple of hours of my life back later. I was right.There was nothing remotely entertaining about the film. I often enjoy bad art for the sake of bad art but this was undigestable.,1
"Don't Order!!!!: Piece of crap. Not compatible with Ipod Touch and I got my son one for Christmas. Instructions are in SPANISH only. Cute to look at, but that is it.",1
"propaganda film: this is clearly a political propaganda film with an agenda wrapped in the inauthentic cloak of a factual unbiased documentary. if you watch this make sure to realize that the editing creates an impression that simply does not match reality. no news organization, no journalistic organization would endorse this as a factual work.",1
Memorial Day is outstanding: I've recently purchased all of Vince Flynn's previous books in paperback so I could read everything he has written in sequence. Memorial Day is another outstandingly written book in the Mitch Rapp series.,2
"is there such thing as a -5 star?: all the reviewers who think this is the worst movie they've ever seen are right. this is the worst movie I ever saw. I saw it free and still want my money back!nothing funny. nothing redeeming. if anyone thought this movie was good simply has a screw loose.Attack of the Killer Tomatoes was better than this....an update after about a year.although I never saw this movie ever again it seems to have a cult following. no, it doesnt even come close to the unforgettable Fast Times at Ridgemont High but i find several lines like ""Idiot"", ""Gosh"", and ""My lips hurt real bad"" being used around the house. The funniest thing about this movie is when John Heder hosted Saturday Night Live and told the story of the inspiration for Napolean coming from several people but not his good friend from college ""Leopold Samsonite"", nor is sidekick ""Jose"".I would still fall asleep during this movie if it played again, but there are a few lines that seem to stick with you for a while.",1
At the Villa of Reduced Circumstances: Not my type of story even though it was well-written. I like his humorous stories instead.,1
"Intersting premise: Not all the way through yet, would like a bit more meat in the book. Up to know a little hard to follow.",2
"It wiggles, it tips, and it stands too high: After purchasing a laptop table more than a year ago for myself, I purchased this one for my wife. It is not as stable as the others we have seen and used, and at the lowest setting it is 6 inches above my waist (I am over 6'3""). My wife is 5'8"" and can only use this stand when sitting on our (elevated) bed. If she jacks an office chair high enough to type on this stand, her feet can barely reach the floor. If they simply drilled the pin holes all the way to the bottom of the vertical cylinder this tray could be used by people as short as 5'10"". A shorter cylinder would be even better.",1
"What a book ! What a great read !!: Smart advise that for any parent in any situation. Kids and their problems. We've all been there,,kids and their problems. Sometimes I thought I'd never get through the day. Dr.Cathryn makes sense of all the everyday issues that we face. I don't know how I managed before this book !! I am SO glad I discovered this book.",2
"Pretty amazing book: The shocking part about the book is not what it tells us about the justice system in Germany during Hitler's reign. That much was to be expected, although the explanations and examples Müller gives are highly enlightening. The truly shocking part is the aftermath--the whitewashing of the guilty lawyers, prosecutors and judges after the war. I consider myself pretty knowledgeable about the Holocaust, but this was all news to me. Pretty amazing.",2
Too Strange: This book was too bizarre to recommend to anyone I know. The first half was interesting because it dealt with race relations in the fifties/sixties. I lost interest in the last half when it dealt with sexuality and pornography. It was too much of a twist in plot.,1
"This one looks more like Cloe then Fianna.: I must say, it is a gotta have. I haven't bought the doll, but have seen it in person however, and the doll itself looks as if its a clone of a Cloe doll rather then Fianna. I think the detail is great make-up is wonderful, the outfit goes perfect, they just should have made her look more like a Fianna. So for me she lost a star due to looking more like another Brat. Other then that I think shes beautiful.",2
"A completely different kind of ""Opera"": Oh...dear. Well, the book and lyrics and plot are way sub standard and different from the ""Phantom"". They make no sense, the characters would NEVER have followed this plotline. The music is much modernized, which is fine, but haradly any of original music or tunes, no ""Opera either. However, the sets, actors and costumes are great. Expect no romance. Better it wssn't tried. There is a little boy that is absolutely terrific all the way through. Best thing about it.",1
"Should have returned...: These are really cute bowls. Unfortunately I find them completely ineffective.Pros:Pretty colorsNo sharp plastic edges or seamsCons:Suction cups are ineffective at keeping the bowl in one place - very easy for the baby to get them unstuckThe bottoms of the bowls are not very wide, so once the suction cup has been disengaged the bowl goes overThe covers don't reliably stay on if you want to put them in a diaper bag or even a lunch boxI suspect that if you don't ever put them in the dishwasher (they are listed as top-rack safe) or even wash them with hot water, they might work better... but who has time for that?",1
product is great: bought this once for myself and it was so great bought a second for my father. easy to operate and takes very little strenght!,2
"The DEW is trouble: If not for the DEW function I would give the camera five stars. Unfortunately when the DEW signal comes on there is no camera and there is no override for this sensor. We wouldn't anticipate a problem with moisture living in Arizona but it's been nothing but problems after the first year. Our first dew warning came when we tried to record our sons first preschool Christmas play - we have no video of that or several other events like birthday parties, visits from family, stunts on the trampoline... I'm counting my blessing that we're just out the cost of new camera because I have been sure my husband would land in the ER with an anger induced stroke on those occasions! The only time the DEW function seemed to go away was during the hot humid summer we spent in the Southeast. Go figure.",1
"Johnny Jump Up: I am completly satisfied with the Evenflo Johnny Jump Up. I bought this to keep at my house when my granddaughter is visiting here. She has one at her house and loved it so much I had to buy one. She gets very excited while jumping and I believe it is good exercise and she has fun while in it.I had one for my kids when they were babies.The Johnny Jump Up can be adjusted according to height, so as to allow free jumping. It is easy to put up and take down and can be put in any doorway so she can be easily seen and she sees us.I am confident that this is a safe product and would recommend it to anyone.",2

"Half the history of Scotland: The two stars I gave it, are for the views and photography.What happened to Mary , Queen of Scotts, Wallace, Robert de Bruce, Queen Victoria, Culloden, Bannockburn, the Knights Templar, etc. So all was invented by a prolific poet and it is not real! Well, then tell us YOUR real Scottish History!!!Wasted money, I would have done better with a tourism DVD!",1
"Please Reprint!: I loved this book as a child. I used to check this book out every time my grandmother took me to the library. Until one day someone never brought it back. That has been over 20 years ago and my grandmother and I still talk about it. I wish they would reprint ""The Grumpus Under the Rug."" It is worth the $50.00 to buy it. Just wish they had more in print so it wouldn't be so expensive.",2
"uncomfortable - ill fitting: This shirt was very uncomfortable - scratchy with no breathability whatsoever. It was also cut very strangely and was ill-fitting. Too short, too wide, shoulders not nearly wide enough, arm cuffs entirely too tight. Wore once - threw away.",1
"BORING!: I have read many adventure/hiking/Alaskan/Arctic non-fiction books. This had to be the most boring book I've read so far. It was not engaging and the writing style was just ""YAWN"". I couldn't even finish it! There are much better books like this out there!! Don't waste your time.",1
Not What I expected: This cami is just like any cami you would wear with any outfit. I would not categorize this as shape wear... Not to mention that it is pretty short in length.,1
"Love this series!: Fast read. As hokey as it sounds to read Jane Austen inspired mysteries, this series is remarkably entertaining and well-written. Love the originality of the story and how true the characters are to Jane Austen's originals. Well worth the puchase. Buy one, you gotta buy them all, as you'll be hooked.",2
"Surprisingly Good: I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I picked it up only because it was filmed in and around the small town where I grew up: Ashcroft, B.C., Canada. (Sorry, people, but that's not really Wyoming.) It was actually a pleasant, thoughtful little film with some fine acting. Too bad the studio didn't try to market it when it was released in theatres.",2
"His brother's is better.: I was really disappointed with this effort. Very bland, lazy works. Anyone these days could spend a few days sitting at their computer punching this auto-mated music out on their own. Sure it has certain Hartnoll-y sounds, but anyone could've imitated this stuff with knowledge of Hartnolls' works from the Orbital days.It could be said that the brothers have mellowed, since both their efforts now seem to be going towards the (gasp!) ""Easy Listening"" realm.......... sigh.Don't waste your money. Listen to the samples and decide for yourself, however.",1
"JORMA BACK ON A MAJOR RECORD LABEL,""HOT _ _ _ _ _ _ JORMA"": A musicians musician back on a major label, GOD BLESS YOU JORMA & KEEP IT ON!

Good value: A little tedious to set up but works as advertised. Option to select warnings that you want to receive was the selling point for me.,2
"Try Again: My IPAQ h6300 received the software upgrade and since then has worked seamlessly. You need to turn off connections so it doesn't search for GPRS, etc. all the time. But that is easy to do with the connection manager. My bluetooth headset now works phenomenally too! It is great to be able to import all of my contacts from outlook and direct dial or email them just by tapping the phone number. Plus Wireless Internet built in, and Word, Excel, etc. on the fly. I have had a phone and PDA both for some time and it is convenient to have both in one, especially with the carrying case that comes with it. Get to know it, then you will love it.",2
Nn captioned or subtitled ?: I have noticed that the Olive Films don't provide captions or subtitled in English. It sucks! Their thoughtlessnessviolated accessibility for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing.,1
"Not even worth one star!: Ordered this as a professional massage chair, but it was clearly not. It is poorly manufactured, the frame was bent, the seat and headrest were stuck in one position, and I couldn't even fold it back down to return it. Very poor quality, reeks of chemical vinyl fumes. Very disappointing! I wouldn't even recommend it for home use, as it won't change positions and cannot be put back in the carrying case once it is set up.",1
"Don't buy it for the audio capability: DVD play is good. I purchased this model specifically because of its CD-R and CD-RW audio capability. Unfortunately, the player more or less consistently skipped the first second of each CD audio song when the songs were not played sequentially. The Phillips technicians told me that ""is not a problem"". That was all I needed to know about Phillips brand. I returned the player.",1
Great Filter: It's exactly what it says. I needed a replacement filer for my vacuum cleaner and this one is perfect.,2
"College=Posters: I used the blue sticky tack Freshman year for a lot of posters and never once had a problem. This semester, using the white scotch stuff, my posters fall on my head in the middle of the night...often multiple times. I'm a bit fed up with that. The quality of this tack is so atrocious compared to the blue putty which is the same price! I just popped on here to get myself some blue putty, saw this product for sale, felt an intense rage build in me (this was a night when my poster fell on my head multiple times), and had to write a review. So, I'm off to buy some good tack. (Hint, not this stuff)",1
"Great Surge Protector: What I like best about this product is that it was easy to set up and there are lots of outlets! Plus, the outlets are placed in a way that make room for large plugs. Because of the design, I was able to plug in more things. The price was right too.",2
MHP-T Bomb II: I have taken this product for 1 month and seen a great differance in my lifting and appearance would reccomend this product to anyone.,2
"Not Bad: I have been using this for about a week now, and I really enjoy the way it makes my mouth & teeth feel. At first I didn't care for the taste, but it's not bad.",2
"Nomad II ..good deal: I bought this player so that i could use it at the gym. I have had nothing but wonderful things to say about it. The user interface is easy to use and the remote control can clip onto your shirt so that you dont have to fumble for the controls on the player. The software they give you allows you to recompress already owed MP3s so that you can fit more mp3s on the player. I have been so busy listening to the player, i have not yet used the recorder or the fm tuner. The lightweight player is perfect to use on the treadmill.I did find putting in the memory was a bit clunky but otherwise I have had no problems at all. I would recommend this player.",2
"Awesome book with great info and valuable references: I first picked up this book at Borders. I immediately became engaged, but didn't necessarily want to spend $30, not because I don't think it's worth it, I'm just cheap. :) Anyway, I got the book on Amazon for about $4.00 w/ shipping and have greatly enjoyed it ever since. I have read some reviews, where people said that some of the information was incorrect, but thus far I'm slightly baffled by that, because almost ever piece of information is referenced to research that was done on the subject. I'm not a scholar or anything. I'm just a 43 year old guy who wants to know more about the one thing you should have some knowledge about...your self.I say get the book and extrapolate what is important to you. Peace~",2
"Suprisingly Good!... and reccomended!: When ""Rumors"" came out, i wasn't sure about how Lindsay's album would be. I didn't really care for the song and it didn't really show how good her voice could be. I listened to the album anyways, since Lindsay is one of my favorite actresses, and i realized that she actually could sing and was good. I enjoyed all of the tracks (besides rumors), epecially First & Over. First is probably my favorite song on the album, its very catchy and upbeat and her voice sounds very good on it. I would reccomend buying this album.",2
"still hates the car!: My son likes to look at the pictures, but only for a few seconds. he still hates the car! The product does seem durable and nice and colorful, but he really hates the car. Giving him a small yot ro chew on seems to help a bit more.",1
"Great world war II game!: This is a great world war II game. Is challenging, fun and exciting. The only bombshell is that multiplayer online isnt so good. It is more of an individual self reliance with no strategy on team play. THE BEST WORLD WAR II FIRST PERSON SHOOTER IS DAY OF DEFEAT:SOURCE (AKA DOD:S)! DOD:S emphasizes team play and requires that each player hone their individual skills to better the chances of the team. Bud DOD:S doesnt have a single player. My suggestion is to get COD for single player and DOD:S for multiplayer. Once you're done with single player, the game can get boring, but multiplayer always depend on how good your opponents are (always varies, there are some crazy good players). Well hope this helps!",2
"Helped me understand myself: This is a very good book- it's well-written, thorough, and engaging. I'd say there is a secret legacy of male depression in American society, but hopefully this condition is improving as less stigma is associated with depression. The book helped me to understand the context of my own battle with depression, giving me new perspective. Avery Z. Conner, author of ""Fevers of the Mind"".",2
"Very bad.: I am a big fan of Dean Koontz, but this one just didn't seem as good as some of his past others. I really wouldn't recommend it, but that's just my opinon.",1
"BIG tortilla keeper: I wanted a tortilla keeper to keep tortillas warm for my family meals. I was expecting it to be about the size of the containers you would find at a Mexican food restaurant, but was surprised to find that it was much larger!I think it would hold about 3 dozed large( burrito sized) tortillas. besides the size, I am very happy with it and have found that it works well for rolls and muffins.",2
"BEST ACTION FILM OF ALL TIME !!: Yes, I would recommend this item. It arrived as advertised, on time, safely packaged, and I had no issues at all.I would def do business with this company again.Excellent product !! One of my BEST movies ever !!Kickass action every few moinutes, you'll never take your eyes of the screen !! -Jim :-)",2
Plate Bent: License was shipped in a brown envolope. It was bent so bad i could not use. I uploaded a picture to the vendor-no responce. I thew it in the trash. Bad Bad Bad,1
Recipes just like mom made.: This is an excellent book of traditional Italian recipes. I bought the book over 25 years ago. It is a softcover book so it needed to be replaced from years of use. I wish there was a hardcover edition with more recipes. I use it all the time.,2
this phone is not worth it buy something else: althouhg this phone is attractive i would not tell anyone to buy it. this phone does not hold charge and finding the batteries has proven to be a mission this phone has not worked correctly since i bought it. should have returned it. dont waste your money,1
Super read: This was my first McNaught book and it was the start of many hours of reading this great author. I wish she would write faster but I understand she writes slow because she wants her books to be perfect and it shows. I loved the characters esp. Nick. This book is a keeper that I pull out frequently an reread and I still enjoy it as much as the first time I read it.,2
"CNN BEWARE: First of all Zane Pilzer is one of America's smartest economists. His approach is by no means mainstream, but well researched and calculated. His conclusions are present in a lucid and cogent manner to be broadly understood. Whether you agree or not is up to your own judgment. Health care can be a very sensitive topic, to say the least, so I admire Zane for cutting through the crap you would hear on TV and suggesting some alternatives. Although I may not always buy into his propositions a fresh approach can be most rewarding as it allows you to expand your understanding of the topic in general.",2
"Still haven't received it: When I get it, I'll let you know. It looks like it could be a nice book. Do most of the books take this long? Are you reading it first?",1
"Grinding wheel dressing stone: Worked very well for rounding a out of round and out of balance 7"" wheel. Also works very well to clean metal that is clogging wheels, and to true the surface.",2
No good for Macs with internal Airports: I received this as a gift. I spent some time on Sunday trying to get it to work on my iBook G4 with its internal AirPort Extreme. Nope. I called HP on Monday and spent 2 hours with a nice person who eventually admitted that this product just won't work with Macs with internal Airports. Sorry!,1
"Ridiculous plot . . .: thought about not finishing book at 27% . . . then, again slmost stopped reading at 52% . . . finally, couldn't take the absurdity of the plot and clicked my Kindle to a new story.Wish I had never started reading this one. I love a good horror or mystery or supernatural tale. This one was awful.What's with sll the good reviews - my opinion of a book has nevrr been so divergent from the avrrage rating. The ""Repairman"" needed to stay home and fix this story's plot, instead of going out to chase those evil vampire/zombie/yeti creatures.Don't waste your time or money -it's just plsin BAD.",1
"Great for narrow feet...hurray!: I bought these shoes at an Easy Spirit outlet store (for, ahem, more money than they cost here on Amazon). I chose the blue upper with a gray bottom in a narrow width. I absolutely love them. Comfy from Day 1, and nicely styled. The blue is perfect to wear with jeans (it's not so bright that it stands out, it's more of a grayish blue). I've been wearing Merrell Primo Breeze shoes for years, and never thought I'd find another pair of slip-ons that are as comfortable or that offered as much support. Easy Spirit has won me over, am I'm not an easy customer (I'm sure others with narrow, picky feet will relate). You can probably find similar shoes that are cheaper, but they won't feel as close to heaven as these do... You definitely will not regret this purchase.",2
"little disappointing: When i received the Snow White DVD in the mail, my daughter wanted to watch it right away. Unfortunately, when we tried to play it in the living room, all we got was a lot of noise from the machine and ""Disk Error"" on the screen. Needless to say I was not very happy. We tried it in the DVD player in my bedroom and it does work in there although the entire time it plays you can hear the disk inside the machine. Since I dont want to have to let my daughter in my room every time she want to watch Snow White, I will probably be buying another copy and hoping for the best.",1
"Real examples, not just code listings: A must-have book! I seldom see a book so well focused on its aims. It is like it screams: ""hey guy, use it do not use that!"" or ""connect works this way, not that way, take a look!"". Every example is quite illustrative and, as if it was not enough, the comments are always helpful.Everyone which wants to develop serious TCP/IP programming must get it. And it can also be read by UNIX programmers as well.",2
"Not Understanding: This book was my second lesbian book I've ever read. And I was taught new things that I never knew were possible with a woman's body and then again some I really didn't want to know. There were some sentences in some of the stories that were sensual more than erotic. I prefer sensual over exotic right now. I guess I didn't know erotic meant exotic. I felt a little bit intimidated by most of the stories and was perplexed by many. I don't think it's a good book for a newly out lesbian like myself as it has mostly hardcore action happening. I wish I could sell it for it is too late to return but I don't wish to read it again. One story I did find quite intriging but not worth buying the whole thing, which was Water Marks by Dawn Dougherty.",1
Lasted 4 minutes with my cocker spaniel.: My cocker spaniel loves squeeky ball and I thought this would be perfect so I ordered 3. Ugh...lasted about 4 minutes with him. I'm hoping to return the other 2.Not good for dogs that are rough on their toys.,1
Extremely slow shipping.... sent via us postal and rooked on shipping costs: for a 5 oz box. I don't believe I will be doing to much business with Amazon anymore. Shipping once again is where companies are lining their pockets.I have a parts business and I charge customers exact fare for postage.,2
Iron Will: Great movie.....We watch it again every year or so and always enjoy it. Excellent family entertainment.,2
"Delta Replacement parts: Excellent. Did the trick, just be careful not to buy unnecessary extra parts. Amazon.com is a great place to shop!",2
"this is a crock: to put out a greatest hits cd like this and slap a piece of garbage song on it like ""again."" who let bryan adams take over lenny's body?the rest of the songs on this cd are great, but if you buy this cd, you are a putz. this is hardly a selection of his best stuff. get the original albums.",1
Excellent Condition: This was the first time I have ever purchased a used book. I couldn't believe what great condition it was in. It looks like a brand new book to me. I would recommend purchases this way to anyone. The price was low and the quality high. Perfect. I'd do again in a heart beat.,2
"What's So Funny?: I found this book not morally complex or sophisticated so much as just plain offensive and cruel. I don't see the point of taking us inside the minds of teens who would even consider such a brutal crime as kidnapping and terrorizing another human being. This has none of the layers and provocative questions of ""Lord of the Flies."" It was, to me, pointless. Most teens I know are interested in cleaner fare, in deep questions about life on other subjects. And despite the predominance of disturbing themes and plots in teen novels, many teens I know look for other books instead; they really aren't that interested in stories of kidnap, rape, incest, suicide, and murder.",1
"A BOOKSHELF KEEPER: One of Anita Shreve's best, though I wish the book had ended a bit sooner. The difficult subject of underage passion with an older, married man is treated with delicacy and beauty. This novel was hard to put down. I'd also recommend ""A Pilot's Wife"" by the same author.",2
"boring...not funny: I found this book boring and not very funny. Most of the stories seem made up, penthouse letters are funnier.",1
"not 6"" x 9"": These envelopes are not close to being 6"" by 9"". I measured them and they are 4 1/2"" x 6 1/2"". I specifically wanted 6"" by 9"" because I had some of the 4 1/2"" by 6 1/2"" envelopes and it was a tight fit. Quality is decent but shouldn't be advertised as 6 x 9.",1
"Very well researched; in great depth and feeling; EXCELLENT: I chose to not have children at age 18 - and I've never regretted it. Now in my thirties, I've spent countless hours reviewing and explaining my choice, often for people who had no right to know but insisted anyway. But here, for the first time ever, all the arguments and thoughts I've had about choosing childnessless are discussed in depth and wonderfully in this book. Ms. Lisle wrote the book I would have written if I could have done so. She has my eternal respect and gratitude for putting in print what I've been trying for years to explain.",2
"This book makes you long for a sequel!: I read this book about 25 years ago and have loved it ever since.It took me years to track down a copy (this was well before Amazon and eBay).This haunting tale will stay with you and leave you longing for the author to write a sequel.I contacted the author and she said she still receives many letters about this book. She wrote in her letter that the picture on the front of the book shown above is the actual Gingerbread House in Colorado. Although the story is ficton, the house actually exists.This book is perfect for a rainy Saturday, when you curl up on the couch with a cup of hot tea.Just a warning, don't read it before you plan on going to sleep!No, you won't be too scared to sleep and it won't give you nightmares, but you will stay up all night, because you can't put it down!!",2
If you're interested in Panda's...: then this is the dvd for you. Informative without being dry. The footage of the Panda's is great. It's good for the entire family. Another quality product from the nature televison program.,2
"Not Good: Double Game has a good idea of the cop who goes around at night shooting up the bad guys. This movie is just not good. The acting is bad in Italian or English. I fell asleep watching it, the pace is not quick. The other DVD is of the sequel, is a better plot but all the same actors from the first movie are in this one but in different roles. Low budget Italian crime films of the 70's. Some are good others aren't. A star for each movie.",1
"snake oil, waste of money, piece of crap.. take your pick: Yeah.. the title says it - don't waste your money on this. Followed instructions: nothing happened. Went around the instructions: still nothing. If you want to waste your money on a product that doesn't do anything, get a pet rock.",1
"Please enter a title for your review: if you're like me and thought lucky mckee's Sick Girl was the clear stand-out from season 1 then you'll probably consider this a close second for the series so far. the main character has the same level of originality, having a unique schizophrenic identity (arguing with the skeletons he lives with that he's dressed up like the family members he believes or pretends they are) that exists separate to his sinister villain status. the idea that he's trying to create this fake ideal family, but he still fights with his imaginary wife, is clever and well executed. a kind of sub-plot of normality within the madness. the twist ending is the most typical uncreative part. i totally didn't see it coming at all but it contradicted the entire previous interesting story rather than concluding it so it's just a total cop-out. full credit for the episode's entertainment value should go to the scriptwriter and actors, the director is of no consequence.",2
"No toy equals one star: I first purchased this book over a year ago ... and before I know it all of Tulsa is talking about how much I like babies. I deeply resent the invasion of my privacy. It is well known that I do not care for babies or ""Daddy books"" and only purchased my copy as an insulting gag gift for a friend of mine who has since decided against adoption. What's worse, unlike ""Baby"" Fulghum's other books, this one did not even come with one of those free toys. Total rip.",1
"S....L....O....W.... B....O....O....K....: Knowing nothing of this book, but being intrigued by the cover, my wife and I picked up the audiobook to listen to while on vacation. We drove across three states wondering if there really was going to be a plot. This book is really for those who like to hear extended descriptions that will continue for pages. Imagine all the chapters from Les Miserables that describe the Battle of Waterloo, the sewer system, and the convent. Well, take all those detailed and monotonous chapters, throw in a wandering child and you have the book. Discovery of a fascinating place with not a lot of story. Sorry, but I had to say it.",1
"Big Machine Performance in a small package: Handled 5.5"" Oak like butter, easy to setup, has a sturdy fence (much better than Grizzly). If you are looking for a good quality bench top jointer look no further.",2
"Couldn't be more Tedious and Boring: I bought 100 Easy Lessons because I knew that it was a popular book. I am convinced that its popularity is a result of people not really knowing that there are other options to learn reading in a systematic way. It is the most tedious excercise in minutae I have ever experienced. RUN from this book! We've heard good things about ""Explode the Code"" as a systematic approach to learning to read. We'll give that a try.",1
"Dont buy this book if you have 2-3 months experience on PHP: This book is very basic learning of PHP...strictly only for PHP beginners. But even for beginners this book would surely get out of date. I thought this book would have some PHP object oriented concepts and code snippets, but it was not.So buy this book only if you have absolutely no knowledge of what is PHP and how to run the PHP code.",1
"Mind-Numbing: I thought the fourth installation in the Riverworld series would be exciting. At last, they are going to reach the tower and confront the unknown entities who have done this to humans! But first, unfortunately, Farmer drags on endlessly about the final gathering of the main characters and the battle between the two paddle wheelers, which drags ON and ON, chapter after chapter, describing each turn and blow ad nauseum. I couldn't even finish it. If my husband would let me, I would donate these books to Goodwill.",1
GREAT DEAL!!!: I purchased this item in 2009 and was very pleased because I only payed $5.00 because their was a promotion going on. usuall it costs $5.99 an issue at stores!!!,2
"Don't waste your time: I absolutely love survival horror games & the Sega Dreamcast. So you'd think that there would be a pretty good chance I'd like ILLBLEED huh? Well, there was, until I played it.Horrible controls hinder this offering. It is too bad really as this game had an interesting premise and could've been something.Ah, what I am worried about... it isn't like any of you people who don't already own it will be able to track it down (or order it at this site) anymore anyway.But for those that try... you've been warned.",1
"The Teacher: The Kybalion, a book about creation. The book I should have read before all others as most other books of this type, at some stage or another or in some form or another, are based on the teachings of The Kybalion. The Kybalion is written for the seeker, I cant say more than that. Amazon made my acquirement of this book a pleasure and as such added to the enjoyment of the reading.",2
"You can't be serious!: Hey, I know Paul Auster has been...in the past...an extraordinary writer. But this book is sloppy to the point of insulting. Lots of tantalizing leads (hence the 2 stars), but absolutely no intelligent follow-up. And he doesn't even bother to TRY making the plot lines cohere. He simply lets them drop from sight. And the whole ""climax"" with Grace and Trause's 2-dimensional son? What inspired that bit of B-grade TV melodrama? Mr Auster is apparently not very concerned about delivering to his readers, folks. Very sad, really.",1
"Inglourious, but just, desserts...: Although violence as entertainment is not my cup of tea, violence against the violent is a horse of a different color. Quentin's suggested retributional methods for the handling of Germany's right-wing extremists might just give pause to some of today's, there and elsewhere. That can only be a good thing.No one can (sanely) deny Tarantino's considerable skills as a filmmaker. Those skills are unquestionably on display here.All of the actors turn in great performances, with Til Schweiger not getting enough attention for his visual portrayal of what is perhaps the most intimidating German soldier in movie history. Luckily for the Inglourious Basterds, he is one of them.If one knows beforehand that the movie is fantasy, sort of a WWII fictional wish-fulfillment, they will enjoy it more. Another ""Valkyrie"" it is not, but, of course, it was not meant to be.",2
"A bit on the melodramatic side: I felt Sylvia Browne's Book ""Adventures of a Psychic"", was a bit on the melodramatic side. I couldn't find anything substantial about the life of, ""Sylvia Browne"", in fact I thought there was an awful lot of blaming the other person for all that went wrong in her life especially in the last chapter. I couldn't believe that anyone who claims to be such a tool for Gods good works could ever stoop so low, as to allow themselves to be promoted in this type of forum usually reserved for Movies, sports, and comedy specials, not spiritualists",1
"Bad design, terrible for big laptops, broke quickly: I'll keep this short and bitter. I have a 17"" laptop (Gateway 7811) that I play games on. Wanted something not too bulky to sit between the laptop and my lap and provide some additional cooling.This thing is a little too small for a laptop of this size but doesn't do too badly. The #1 main issue is the terrible USB plug design. The power plug piece broke due to cord placement. Overall, when working, it provided a very small amount of cooling (about 4-5 degrees according to speedfan). The inability to turn off the super bright blue LED, the cord storage panel on the bottom popping off frequently, and the overall cheap quality of design/materials all contributed to me hating this thing. But the terrible USB power plug design was really the main issue. That plug will snap or break, it's only a matter of time.",1
"Disappointing because.....: It's too bad when a small company with a good idea becomes a large commercial machine with little content. I'm so sick of seeing Baby Einstein advertising itself everywhere - even within their own videos once you've already purchased them. It's the same old stuff you see recycled in almost all of their baby videos - once you have one, you pretty much own the entire set. I do think there is some value in infant videos and they can do more than just babysit your children. But there doesn't seem to be a good bridge between Baby Einstein and videos like Blue's Clues or Sesame Street. Juno Baby is a very nice and cute transition with some characters and pretty music and offers a bit more stimulation. Another nice idea might be the Sesame Street for babies videos which are supposed to come out pretty soon. The bottom line is that I think Baby Einstein sells babies a little short and underestimates what they're capable of hearing and understanding.",1
cute but doesn't fit: Cute product but it falls off easy and that was the first thing my son went for when he was in the tub. Needs to have some sort of fastener or something.,1
"Made in China , NOT Germany: I assume the item may have been made in Germany at one time. It is now made in China by a German company. It looked sturdy, but in my experience Chinese Stainless is not as it should be, and will rust (why does there seem to be a different standard of quality?). The item was heavy and seemed like it is usable. Give it a try if you want, but when Amazon states it is German made, I expect it to be that. I have returned it.",1
"Blues for Everyone: The Muddy Harbor Band's newest album, Too Much Anchor, is blues that offers something for everyone. The band seamlessly mixes a variety of genres including jazz and swing to create a unique style of blues. The musical talent of this group will blow you away. The saxophone parts resonate deep in your soul and the drummer is perhaps one of the best around.",2
fisher price infant-2-toddler rocker: great gift. I bought a few and the parents loved them.they say their babies love it because of the vibrations.I like it because your child can grow up with it and havetheir own special place to read or take on trips.2 thumbs up for this one.,2
"You can find better FREE online games: This game is crap. The main reason is because when you join, they FORCE you to rejoin! They will keep billing you! And there is no way to tell them to stop, unless you find their number when you get billed, and hope that they'll refund it. The game also isn't very good. I recomend 1 month of it, the game is pretty fun, but the fun wears off in about a month",1

"Broken Upon Arrival: I received this item and one of the plastic bars was broken. It is not worth it to me to return but I am disappointed because had I chosen to listen to the other reviewer's comments regarding the sticky sticker and fragile quality of the product I might have saved some money.To be fair, had the tray arrived without a broken bar and if I wanted to take the time to remove the sticker (why they didn't put the sticker on the bottom of the mirror i will never know) it appears to be a decent product and worth the $19.00 +/-. I hope this review helps you make an more informed decision. -",1

Heavy and bad a**: This album is one of Judas Priest's best albums they put out even though i think every album by Priest is subperb. They played the heaviest and with fury on this album.

This is a must if you love heavy heavy metal buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,2
"THIS IS IT- CERTAINLY IS!!!!: ""THIS IS IT"" certainly would have been a concert to end ALL concerts. The hour and a half footage (not in the original film) showed a blockbuster of costumes, memories of MJ and what the concert would have entailed. NO ONE would have topped this.....and what a way to go out...ON TOP!! I wish the good Lord could have let him perform just ONE concert in London---just to show the magnitude of this concert masterpiece. No doubt, MJ will always be the best entertainer that ever lived. THIS IS IT is a MUST BUY!!!!!!",2
"Dries out my hair: I have been using this product for more than 3 months. I swore that when my big bottle is used up that I would stop using it because it leaves my hair matted after washing it. And yes, I have used their conditioner which is useless. I have coarse hair but this stuff is leaving it like straw, and it dries it out. I have experimented to see if it was this product by using a few others in between uses. Sure enough, it is only after I use Redkin that I experience the undesired results. I cannot recommend this brand or product.",1
"This book is a MUST for people recovering from bankruptcy: I attended to one of Stephen's seminars in Denver sometime back in 1998. I am hearing impaired and I did not have a sign language interpreter but the information that Stephen went over on the highlight were very impressive. They gave me ""Credit After bankruptcy"" book. I read the book about 5 times. I learned how to budget my money better. I also signed up with one of credit attorney service and they helped removed 21 creditors off my credit report and boosted my credit score up to almost 100 point in only 9 months... even if I still have bankruptcy still stained on my credit report. The book is not neccessarily always 'cure' for bankruptcy but CAN help you start your financial life anew! I strongly recommend the book!Good luck, Erik Diamond, Denver Colorado",2
not ok for professionals.: I am a drywall who hangs six day a week and was looking for something like this. when I saw 5/8 on there I thought great. so I got one. (to the person/s who made this product.) You should have tested it first because unless you weight 200lbs or more you can not hold a 4x12 sheet of drywall 1/2 let alone 5/8.my rating on this product is don't waste your time.,1
"Disappointed: Having first listened to this band with the excellent MECHANIZED WARFARE (2001), I decide to know some of their catalogue, and bought AGE OF MASTERY (1998).This only served to respect and enjoy MECHANIZED WARFARE even more, since I was astonished to realized how tha band matured, evolved ande developed a sound of their own, even being firmly based in classic heavy metal.AGE OF MASTERY is so cliched and juvenile that you'll have to be really patient to listen it entirely. The vocals are ridiculously over the top and annoying (incredible, since they are handled by the same Henry Conklin of Mechanized Warfare). All in all, a generic and medicore effort, although of course the guitar players clearly are very good in their business.",1
"A personal review: Reading Adrian Dvir's book is a life-changing experience. We accompany the author on his journey from the uneasiness of unexplained experiences, through the inescapable recognition that something he knew little about was happening to him, to his decision to investigate. As the author, a scientifically-minded computer engineer, learns about the other-dimensional world, so too worlds of new dimensions open before the reader and we are rewarded with a glimpse at the enormity of what we don't know. We are but a new-born speck in the universes of life-forms. Other intelligences are here and they are helping. Given the first-person accounts, reports and actual results, this conclusion is unavoidable, despite the ridiculous human tendency to smile and dismiss such concepts. For those readers brave enough to absorb and embrace shatteringly revolutionary concepts - the world, the universe and our place in it, are irrevocably changed. I'd say that makes it worth a read!",2
"Great arcade games !: I love this old arcade games. I remember when young playing Defender and Robotron, and this disk faithfullyreproduces this games. The only diference is that ussing the dualshock controler makes it more dificult than ussing the controlers on the arcade machines.",2
The second one sent worked: The first one that they sent me had a defect in that the LCD display was blank. The second one that they sent me worked fine except that there is no way to turn off the automatic track change when there is a space in a song or recording. It jumps track number or sometimes it doesn't jump at all and it won't let you skip tracks while running continuous from an outside source. It'll do for a quick copy but it has features (as described above) that are irritating.,2
"Graham is a Man of God: Fight The Good FightHaving been a member of Prestonwood Baptist Church and sat under the ministry of Dr. Jack Graham for four years, I believe that he is truly a man of God. A great leader who has served as the President of the Southern Baptist Convention for two terms. My wife and I have purchased this book to give to others.",2
"Curious motivations.: What this movie boils down to is one great battle scene surrounded by incessant character assassination. Why, more than two thousand years later, a popular director should be so offended by a historical figure as to create work of such intense defamation has to be wondered about.The film segments which show any of the major characters in anything resembling a positive nature could be edited down to several minutes in total. The remainder is dedicated to proving that Macedonians were foul people, their leaders even more foul, and the world around them only a debauched cesspool.Three versions now of this pejorative portrayal. How could one director be so obsessed with such perverseness?",1
"Excellent Beginner Book!: I purchased this and Building Simple Model Steam Engines by Tubal Cain to get a start in model making. While both are fantastic, this is a superior beginner book. Mr. Bray explains in detail boiler construction, engine construction, proper plumbing, fittings, and valves, all things you might not think about. It is filled with well dimensioned drawings, high quality useful photographs, and fantastic tips. Simple a fantastic way to begin. I don't think a better book has been written for the novice.",2
"Disappointing: This product was very good at showing the basic principles of Visual Basic but after the initial example program, the text became very technical, defintely not for the first time programmer ( there was absolutely no help in learning to write code).The examples were next to impossible to find on the accompanying software. File names were different from those cited in the book.Overall I would not recommend this product but would steer the beginner towards John Smiley's products.",1
"HUGE MISTAKE BLONDIE!!: this woman ruined some great songs here ladies and gentlemen!!What's up with the re-make of Angels? (Robbie Williams' song) HE sings it so beautifully and jessica just came right along and decided to shout the lyrics out practically! This woman killed my song like BADLY...I think GOD sent her the wrong message really. Now another song, Take My Breath Away (I forgot the original singer) nonetheless IT IS A BEAUTIFUL song til jessica got her hands on it. REALLY THIS WOMAN JUST SUX AT DOING COVERS OF OTHER ARTISTS' SONGS...someone in another review said she tried her best to make this album but really it isnt hard ruining a song and it sure doesnt take that long really. I still say GOD gave her the wrong message im sure GOD is telling her not to sing anymore after this album!!",1
"Simply Awful: This is the worst album Amy has ever done. Worse than House of Love. Worse than Behind the Eyes. Ugh. The songs are lifeless, without conviction, without reverence. Unexcusable for hymns. Instead of shifting around from bluegrass to Chris Isaak-style to who knows what, the album should have been done totally in Amy's trademark acoustic style. The album simply never gains a footing, never gets on track. A poor showing for her first studio album in what, five years? I'm just not sure what to think about her music anymore. I'd get rid of this album except I want a complete Amy collection. I will take it out of my 100-disc changer though, and let it collect dust on the shelf where it belongs. Now I'm going to go listen to Fernando Ortega's ""Hymns and Meditations"" to cleanse this CD from my system.",1
"Hype: These headphones came highly recommended, I only wish I could say the same for anyone else purchasing these cans. I'll admit the sound is genuine, but these headphones only work with certain genres and its appeal starts to wear off when you realize these headphones are a one trick pony. Comfort isn't great but was never an issue, my problem is the build quality. After nearly a month of purchase, the left channel started buzzing like crazy! For no reason, they were very well taken care of! Now I'm having to ship these headphones to Brooklyn to have them repaired! From what I've read Grado takes incredibly long to actually do the repairs, and many of them come back with the same issues that plague them before shipping!Buyer beware!!!These headphones are nothing but hype, and are certainly not worth 100 dollars.YOU WILL REGRET THIS PURCHASE",1
"Fixation on racing results, not the car itself: Since the book ""Original AC Cobra"" is out-of-print and so expensive, I decided to give this book a look. It was very disappointing. It had a bit about the car, and a few interesting pages of historical overview of what the main players (Tojeiro, Shelby, and AC) were up to before the Cobra project.The problem is that once the book got to what should be the meat of the story, it devolved to a ""this person drove that car is this race, and experienced blah blah blah DNF"".While I realize that the Shelby's whole motivation was to go racing, I was expecting a more reasonable balance between information about the car and the races.There were a few redeeming characteristics of the book. A few interesting photographs of the frames, some assembly line photos, and assembly-line information about all the orginal Cobras.Bottom line, get this book if you are interested in the racing history. Skip it if you are looking for much information about the cars themselves.",1
"Wrong item: I had to return this item -- I'd ordered a CD, but received a 7-inch record instead. The good news is that my return went quite smoothly, and I was credited the cost of the item to my account.",1
"ok, but needs a lot of work: when i bought all star baseball 2003, i was expecting stellar gameplay along with great graphics and lots of options to choose from. this, however, was not the case. sure, the graphics were excellent, but that was to be expected. i found the gameplay mixed-up and hard to understand. the first ten games i played, i couldn't even catch a fly ball that was hit to the outfield. As for options... wait a minute, what options. this game gives you no way to customise the type of game you want to play. you can't make the game shorter by making less innings; you can't, in my experience, set the game options at all. overall, i would not buy this game. ...",1
"Dark Shadows: I have always loved Dark Shadows.I started watching when I was 4 years old. What I want to know, does Amazon sell every show that was on TV for so many years? If so, do they sell the complete set? Please, someone let me know. This is one show I would dearly love to own! Thanks, Cathy",2
"Just amazing for the price: I just love it. Is a really nice lens for the price. Pretty clear, I had nice shots impossible without flash with my other lens (3.5-5.6). Every body with an SLR camera should owned this one",2
Thx for the problems: I cant believe the amount of trouble and headaches i have been getting trying to use this product after the 15 day trial period. WHy is there a trial period for a product you have purchased. Neither amazon nor norton has been helpful in resolving the product code issue. They pawn the problem off on the other. I have been trying to return it but have ben unable. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!,1
"3.5 stars out of 4: The Bottom Line:Though the Godfather Part II shows flashes of brilliance, it's also very long and the timeline featuring young Vito, though well-done, does not seem exigent; all things considered it's a good film, but it doesn't match up to the original.",2
"Love this show!: The DVD works fine....and having already seen this series, there were no surprises. Highly recommend for anyone that wants to be entertained.",2
"Este pedal se las trae: Me encanta las posibilidades que este pedal trae, además de la relación precio/valor.Eso si, necesité incorporar un pedal reductor de ruido.",2
"Never even got to try it!!: It came in a cheap plastic bag with plastic snaps. The ""switch"" assembly disintegrated taking it out of the bag, and the battery compartment is virtually inaccessible without ripping the back cover. Very disappointed. Returned it for refund immediately.",1
Recovery: Excellent book for use in 12-step programs. I have had one copy for a long time and ordered additional copies for friends.,2
Waste of time and money: If you are reading this review you have a computer. If you have a computer you can go to the FBI website and review pretty much every ounce of information contained in this book. This book is a waste of time and you would be better served buying yourself a cup of coffee and relaxing for an hour than scanning this book for the one piece of information it might contain that is not on the website.,1
"Dead Poets is realistic and heartbraking: I fist viewed ""Dead Poet's Society"" in school about a year ago. This movie touched me in ways few other films have. Watching the movie, I could really feel the pain of the charactors as the struggled with different situations. Robin Williams gives a believable performance as well.",2
"Hose is useless after two months: I didn't use the hose very much at first so the problems with it didn't become evident until now (2 months later and too late to return it). With the hose under pressure, the layers (plys) come apart and stop up the hose from inside. I've had to cut off the top 10-15 feet and put a new end on it. Now another section below that is breaking down. This is a very poorly made hose.",1
fuller screwdriver kit: Kit is junk. one of the nut drivers didn't have the opening broached into the blank so it is not useful. some of the tools are cocked in the handle making them useless. This is typical imported junk that cannot be used.,1
"Undeveloped Characters: I quit reading after about 20 pages. Goldman slaps the reader with about 30 characters' names in just those 20 pages! Names of people a reader is supposed to believe in; however, none of the characters are ever developed. I'll return to GOOD mysteries and murders.",1
"Nice Mats: The Mats are nice, Heavy, not cheap. Color is good, and they are not too stinky, as in vinyl stinky. Would buy again.",2
"Slow and Ugly...: As a huge Linda Howard fan, I bought Killing Time the day it came out in stores. I should have waited until I read some of these reviews. Then I could have avoided the experience of reading this book. I've never had trouble finishing a Howard novel, until I picked up Killing Time. Knox Davis is just an okay guy. The time-traveling Nikita is cold, and as synthetic as her clothing. Forget the murder and mayhem; how their romantic relationship could have developed is the true mystery in this book.",1
"Non-slip shower treads: Excellent product, easy to apply. Be sure to clean the bottom of the tub or shower and make sure it is dry before applying strips. I would recommend this product. It works GREAT!",2
"not like this Josh, not like this: It seems Joshua wanted to make some quick money. The stuff in this book is nothing new and nothing exiting. What about your crazy random experimental stuff Josh ? What about the sound, 3d and everything we go visit your website man ?",1
The Best GN'R Book Ever!: So far the best Guns N' Roses book ever published. It's an atribute to the best band in Rock history. If you are a real GN'R fan this book its definitely for you.,2
"Not in Spanish: Although this coloring book is titled Spanish Edition it is in English. The pictures are very beautiful, but it has a Hindu theme. Not exactly what I was looking for when I purchased it.",1
"Which is more interesting...: ...music and the people who create it, or music executives and the deals they grind out?If you answered the latter, this book is for you. If you answered the former, you will be exasperatingly disappointed by this book.Good writing, tedious content.",1
"Does Not Charge iPhone: The product charges and plays music with my iPod, but does NOT charge my iPhone. I need a product that both charges and plays music from my iPhone. That needs to be much clearer. Sending back.",1
"Real good: This is a very good product. I've had it for a few weeks now and the sound quality is great. And I really love the recorder. I wish certain features made the music more in order, but it's not bad.",2
"No DVD in the Case: The packaging was great, just no DVD inside the case. No response to my email & the item is now out of stock. First time I've ever had a problem.",1
"Great resource to understanding the why behind stats: I should firstly add that i've only read half the book but i am hoping that the trend of the book continues throughout and assume it to be just. I thought this book was a marvel at taking a topic normally not too interesting to people outside the field. The author managed to take this topic and make it interesting with his weaving of history, stories and explanation of why the formulas were created and used. A great into or refresher for people thinking about measuring data or using any form of statistics.",2
The 5 Love Languages: I purchased this book for an assignment in one of my courses. I love this book! It ended up being so much better than I thought it would! I actually shared the information with my husband and it became useful in our marriage. The author provides you with so many helpful ideas.,2
"satrgirl review: This book is ok. I would recomed this book to people that like romace. I didn't like the book becuase it is a little too romacey for me. But what every. Leo likes her but he is to sacerd to tell her, but he wants to be liked by everybody else.She trys to be popuarl. But it doesn't work becuase she chrees for other teams.",1
"Don't waste your money: Walter Coddington obviously knows very little about the business world. Another case of someone who does not know real world but tries to be a self proclaimed expert in something. He likes to drop names and list sources but the man lacks any sort of charisma or business sense. This is an obvious attempt to publish something just to use it as another reference for himself, there is no useful information in this text that is not common sense. There are much better sources on the subject if you make any effort to look, probably the same ones Mr. Coddington used I'm sure.",1
"My favourite video yoga teacher!: From the moment Mr Yee introduces himself to you, you are with him. He is gentle and such a friendly presence that even though he is so graceful and strong you are never intimidated by him. I work with this videotape every morning before breakfast. I go to yoga classes too, to supplement the instruction on the tape, and have read some books on yoga so that I understand more clearly the poses I am doing with Rodney Yee. I don't advise doing any tape in a vacuum, without supplementary knowledge, but Yee's is a wonderful introduction to the flow of vinyasa postures.",2
"YEah!: Yes, another trend band! Wo hoo, now we can add them to such great classic scenester groups as Papa Roach, Green Day, Devildriver and other such money-grubbing scum! If you want a band that went from playing fake, watered down thrash to vapid nu-metal and then talentless trendy metalcore, look no further!Recommended to fans of Trivium, Hellyeah, Atreyu, and other such great, talented bands!",1
"Off The Hook makes me want to get on my feet!: Off The Hook got my attention the first time I heard it.I""m anxious to hear more like it.I definetly am going to add it to my collection.",2
"Very Uncomfortable: The title says it all. This bra is not comfortable. Also, the cup does not fit properly. I put it in the charity box after one wearing.",1

"I guess I'm the only person with a BOOTAY: I'm 5'4"" and 125 pounds and a runner. I have a bootay thatcan compete with any J.Lo on the planet and I'm not talking fat.My hips are 37 inches and the medium fit / but if I moved itdid not fit (ride up). The large fit better - but then theleg openings were too large.Bootay is not a bad thing to have these days!But these underpants certainly don't celebrate that.If you have any REAL junk in your trunk (muscle)then move on...I can see the wash-ability of these, but I'm not traveling.I'm living in them...and real life clothing goes in the washer.Just thought I'd try them. Light weight / but don't matchany of my shiny bras... in appearance...pass.",1
"Watered-down version of Celebration of Discipline: Soul Feast may be wonderful for Sunday School or other group studies, but readers who are looking for a resource for truly deepening their spiritual lives will find this book long on nice-sounding ideas and warm fuzzy feelings, but short on real content and suggestions for practice. It is a watered down version of Richard Foster's seminal work Celebration of Discipline.Soul Feast can be helpful, but don't think you're getting a meaty guide. Every time it starts to seem meaty, there's a footnote to Foster. Buy the real thing.",1
"Wonderful lens: Im using it with canon 60D for underwater photography and videography and its amazing.Its not too wide and not too narrow, so you can zooming in and out with clear pictures.Thank you so much",2
"WOW...: Lions is an album that stands alone in a world of teenie bop music. At times very funky and other times very jagged. Every song on this album is very strong. One of the most diverse albums I've heard in a long time. My personal favorites on this album are Ozone Mama (funkish), Soul Singin (soulish)', Cypress Tree, Greasy Grass River, and Cosmic Friend (very Beatles-esque. Start to finnish an incredible album that should be in all Crowe's fan's collection, or even just Rock n Roll fans in general. A MUST buy!",2
3 Dimensional characters: I loved this book for its three dimensional characters. The suspense is not there like it was in Night Sins but thiss book is more about the two main characters overcoming their own self-torment and finally accepting happiness and love. Tami Hoag does an excellent job in fleshing out the two main characters and making them three dimensional. I enjoyed this book because of Laurel and Jack and not for the plot. I highly recommend this book.,2
"A MUST READ FOR EVERY HUMAN!: The Grief Recovery Handbook was referred to me by Don Elium, who is and incredible councilor and wise man! After the death of my father, and a series of hard life events that followed, i found myself in a place i had never been before, and i didn't like it! I have realized that just by reading this book, doing the work and discussing grief with people, that EVERYONE can relate at some level, and HARDLY ANYONE is taught healthy coping measures to grieving in our society at large. I have referred this book to people for not only grieving the loss of a loved one, but for divorce, miscarriages, death of a dream... such a useful tool, dispelling the myths around grief and ways of actually moving through it in a healthy way! :)",2
Waste Of Time: Watched about 30 min of this movie before my 11 year old walked out of the room and my 7 year old asked me to turn it off because it was stupid. The video quality is equivalent to that of youtube. The story is not creative. I would not recommend this movie even to a person I disliked..,1
"Unable to put it down: Loved the book. Very insightful, thought provoking as well as entertaining. Since the book was written 1994, I am anxiously awaiting the sequel.",2
"Did not cook my rice: Maybe my water is too hard,but after boiling and boiling, the rice never cooked. I would not recommend this unless you have used an item like this before.",1
"Ecumenical treatise: I was absorbed by this book, having just read Memory and Identity. This book truly reflects on how the church can celebrate difference and still be united in its mission to the world. Truly Christ died for the world and it is in this spirit that the answers are made to the very vital questions that are asked. All religions have a place but Christ is the way to the Father through His sacrifice on the Cross which no other religious leader was called to do. It is this that marks Jesus as the way to salvation and He is the hope of the world. I think any christian or non christian will be challenged by this book and all divisions will fade away as the Truth is seen and received. I pray that with the passing of the Pope that his writings will have a more powerful place in leading other's in the way of Truth.",2
"This book even gives tabloid a good name: The reason there is no input from the man himself is because he hates this book. For the Harry Potter fans, I think this book levels with the writings of Rita Skeeter. Wikipedia has a better bio than this book.",1
good reading: any of the millionaire books are very good reading . they have a very good story line and a good ending. they are just feel good books,2
Ed Emberly Rocks: Ed Emberly is such a fun artist and this is addicting to play with. We have had lots of fun with it. It is a must have for art lovers of any age.,2
"Easy Assembly, Quiet & Small: Had no trouble putting this together. It is well built, strong and stable on a carpeted floor. Light enough to move around so it needn't be intrusive in small rooms. My only complaint is the foot rests--my heel slips off too easily. Helps to have sharp heeled shoes as opposed to rounded, but the toe straps have to be almost uncomfortably tight. Otherwise, fine little machine. I plan to wear it out!Update 1/7/12: Wore the seat rollers out after less than 1000 strokes. I've alerted Stamina. Standby....",2
"visions corning 3.5 quart cook pot w/lid, amber: I broght this item in Chirsmx's time, it is very fast shipping service, also, I got email for shipping information, good service, only 3 days I already rec'd it, I use that to make soup with slow cook, it come out very nice, also, I put hold pot in frag, it still ok! very good! I will buy some difference size later too!",2
"so so quality kit, high price: What you you are basically getting is a very expensive glasses cleaning kit from which you can get for half the price at Walmart and friends. The moist lens cleaning cloth is good to keep in your camera bag for emergency cleaning, but mine came a bit dried out. Microfiber cloth is excellent quality. I would not purchase again though.",1
"R.O.Whack: I don't know whether the criteria for being and R&B princess has been lowered to if you look good then you can get away with it, cos this girl cant sing. It sounds like a teenager struggling with puberty. If she truly believes what 'No Daddy' claims then a lot of young women gonna end up old and alone. It aint worth copping this album wait till someone else purchases then borrow it.",1
Not worth the price: I have bought much better stuff for $10.00. These squirties wouldn't have lasted long. I had to return them.,1
"Beautiful!: This is quite a lovely story, with great illustrations (by the same person who did ""The Stinky Cheese Man""). Humorous, happy, and not just for children.By the way, my mother works in a press, and upon showing up with this book the entire (admittedly small) press was simply amazed by the production. For the price you pay for it, this book is very, very beautifully produced.",2
"Don't buy this ink cartridge!: My first clue that something was amiss was that this product does not come in ""retail packaging""; rather, it's packaged in a plain white cardboard sleeve, and the leaflet with directions is written in French.The cartridge itself is useless. I tried printing a photo, and all that printed were a few purple lines at the top of the page.",1
"The best locket ever!: My husband bought me one of these 6 picture lockets many years ago and I carry photos of him, my kids and my dog inside. I especially like to wear it whenever I'm traveling alone. If I start feeling lonely, I open it for a quick glance at my family's smiling faces. I bought the same locket for a couple of my friends after they raved over mine. It's pretty, not too heavy and well made. I love it!",2
"cute piano but horrific odor: This little toy piano is adorable. Unfortunately, when I opened the box I was shocked by an awful odor---it smelled like a powerful insecticide. I removed all the parts from the box and put them out on my screened porch for a few hours. This did not help.I would NEVER give this piano to my grandchild.",1
"Solution to the auto-reverse problem: I bought this today and Im testing right now as we speak lol. Works and sounds great. I have the solution to the auto-reverse problem. If you have the auto-reverse problem, simply open the cassette up by unscrewing all the screws. Once inside the cassette, take out the gear in the middle. Close it back up, and the problem should be fixed. Now I can listen to cd's in my 95 Buick Century! Thanks god!",2
"Confusing and fragmented: I've put this book down so many times in the last week in frustration. A book of this length usually only takes me a day or two to read, but this one makes so little sense that it's taken forever. The author jumps from thing to thing and place to place with little regard for her reader, who ends up lost and confused. I still have no idea who half the people in this book are or why they were in it, or how they relate to anyone else. The book is horribly hard to follow and therefore lost my interest far too often. I've not read anything else by this author, and using this book as a guide, I doubt I will in the future.",1
"Second one: This is the second time I purchased this item. The first unit stopped working when I used it in a different car. When I read the manual with the second unit I purchased I noticed there is a replaceable fuse to check if the item no longer works. If I had checked this first I would have bought the fuse instead of another unit. For the other reviews that talk about it not working, check if the fuse was blown by your car's voltage. Worked for years in my Honda, but blew instantly in a Jaguar.",2
"Blues For Life: This was the only thing that I wanted for Christmas and I got it! As an owner of most of the previous SRV releases, this stands out because the set consists mainly of previously unreleased material. The live stuff is just amazing and I get goose bumps just listening to the sweet solos that he produces from that guitar. Definitely a nice look from the beginning to the end and the growth of his career throughout. There is a DVD in this set, but I have yet to purchase a DVD player, so I look foreward to the day that I can watch it.",2
"I thought that ""The Sun Also Rises"" had no story: I did not like the book because it had no story. It did not keep my nose in it, I love all of Hemingways other books but this one is the worst one I have ever read. I do not recommend this book to anyone, but if you like it then I cannot change your opinion",1
depressing: It's been a while since I've read this book. I remember it was depressing and definately not a re-read. In fact I think I traded it in for something else and that is a rare thing for me to do because my books are precious to me.I was disappointed in the heroine and the hero.I was glad when it was over.I would not recommend this one.,1
power stick: This stick blender is pretty powerful and I love the brushed chrome finish on it as well. It is easy to use and clean and easy to store... It's a 'good to have'!,2
Another great Froese solo work: Froese is back at it with this album from 1978. It has great sequencers and effects. There are some great melodies laid over awesome backing tracks. I recommend this cd to all fans of Tangerine Dream.,2
"Great short term, terrible long term: The steamer worked absolutely great the first few months but then started leaking and left water stains on my desk and floor. Now I need to buy another one.",1
Bunches up under foot: I wore it several partial days and had to take it off each time. It balls up under my foot and causes more discomfort than I have without it,1
"excellent gun: I have had this gun since christmas and it hasn't gotten damaged at all. It shoots far but if the darts get bent they go like 8 feet. It doesn't jam too much, and if it does it is easy to fix overall it is really good. <(o_o)>",2
"Mr Coffee has cheapened the construction!: We had one of these for many years and it provided great service but eventually wore out, so we bought another one. It has a much cheaper fit and finish than the old one. The bowl has a looser much less positive fit. The lid used to snap fit closed, now it does not, so when emptying the bowl it makes a mess of grounds on our kitchen counter. Worse of all, they shortened the electric cord by so much that it no longer reaches a standard height kitchen outlet, this means the grinder must be held up in the air with two hands near the outlet when ginding.

"As good as TV can get: The show has a few qualities that are rare for Network television.1) Unique visual editing, spanning between scenes with multiple windows2) Unique sound editing. The sound is cinema quality. You don't get that on television much3) Great and refreshing writing. The protagonist is hardly the do everything by the book guy. He is as close to super hero as it comes. He does what it takes to win. But more to the point, you don't know what will happen next. The twists and turns are rocky and entertaining.4) Realtime aspect. Though at points you'd wonder how someone can travel LA so easily, overall, the 24 hour concept in realtime is great.The best television as far as thrillers and suspense go.",2
"What a disappointment: I generally enjoy SOME of Oprah's books, but this one was definitely a poor choice. The plot, which is all one can focus on because the style isn't particularly inventive or interesting, drags along from beginning to end. I was praying for the predictable ending. When it came, I felt nothing for the characters involved.",1

Too easy, not good story line ( rushes into a big story), small levels, and, well just about everything! I would recommened renting before buying, you might like it. But, DO NOT BUY without trying it. ...",1
"Happy with product not with delivery: Bought it for my godson easter as we saw movie together and had great laughs (and he did again he told me). Poor delivery after over 2 weeks, product hasn't yet arrived even on UPS. Amazon swiftly replaced it and sent it at no charge. So great. BUT...then received returning ""eticketing"" and was told to resend a package which hasn't arrived otherwise my credit card would be charged. Told Amazon they should hassle carrier which hasn't ""kept his promise"", organise quality service rather than hassle customer. Especially when i'm in europe and the whole issue happens in USA, it was a present and i have to hassle friends i wanted to treat because of unefficient, uncustomer friendly carrier. I told friends not to bother. If i have to pay twice, so be it. Next time i won t use Amazon in USA - not because of their service but because of their carrier unservice.",1

So I got the U.S. version, all I can say is it's terrible. In the british version, all the aliens were dubbed with hilarious English accents and didn't sound like dodgy Jawa's out of Star Wars.All I've got to say is, watch the English dubbed version if you get the chance. It's a completely different movie...",1

"Please add this CD to your collection!: I borrowed this CD from a close friend after he raved about Mark's delivery of ""Don't Laugh At Me"" and had to purchase it for my personal collection. His smooth vocals, the tight harmonies, the heartfelt ballads .... UNBELIEVABLE! My 8-year-old daughter is especially fond of ""Emily Harper"" since she shares the same first name. The icing on the cake ... I've been fortunate enough to hear him in a personal accoustic setting with one other guitarist from his band! Certainly an experience that will last a lifetime!!",2
"Ridiculous: I only got through 10 minutes of this film, it was that bad. I was looking forward to a humorous, at times thought-provoking story line, but this was just a waste of time, even the ten minutes I gave it. Madea's character is way over the top, and it seems like Tyler Perry just keeps re-making the same movie, except each time its a little worse. I love Diary of a Mad Black Woman and The Family that Preys. This movie is not good.",1
cirque du freak (three books in one): My 7th graders like to read this series. This book has 3 of the series within (I believe books 1-3).

It is fast, great image sharpness, and useful in nearly every application.",2

"A MAN AND HIS BLUES... the great BB KING...: His real name is Riley B. King, the B.B. stands for Blues Boy, and he is known as ""America's ambassador of the blues"". A recommended enjoyable, good read about growing up and into music, self-taught guitar, remarkable attitudes of a man who faced prejudice and hate with an even keel. A performer who went on stage even when he was suffering from a bad case of flu. B.B. King took his music to Israel, England, and Russia, and held up in stature through the lows and highs. And he loves his 'Lucille' (guitar)! David Ritz has co-authored with the King a wonderful synopsis of love, fortitude, belonging, and enthusiasm. Recommended for blues lovers or otherwise... please don't miss this splendid read. (Review based on hardcover 1996)Reviewer also recommends: 'Between Each Line of Pain and Glory My Life Story' by Gladys Knight",2
"dross: This book is very poorly written and consists of fabrications and distortions of the truth. The author is considered by many to be an anti-Semite. I find it surprising that anyone other than the author would rate this book. One can reasonably come to the conclusion that the author signs in as various aliases so that he can boost the ratings of his book by giving it 5 stars.The Law School is by no means racist and given that this book is written by someone who holds anti-Semitic views, I very much doubt the reliability of this account of the supposed incident that took place in the Law school.Avoid at all costs as it is likely to cause major offense.",1
"Worst Doctor Who episode ever...: This is the worst Doctor Who adventure that Ive ever seen. Ive seen everything, mind you, from the 1963-1989 run (and I mean everything), and this is the stupidest and cheesiest one of them all. Having the Doctor battle bounty hunters and aliens at a rock and roll, 50s style holiday is as bad as it sounds. Terrible writing, bad music, silly makeup, etc., make this the worst Doctor Who adventure ever. It's worst than Hartnell's The Gunfighters (which was considered the worst in Doctor Who history until this one), and it's worse than the American TV movie of the Doctor.McCoy and the cast try their best, but they can't overcome the thinness and triteness of the writing. McCoy was a good Doctor (none of the actors who have played the Doctor are awful, in fact, they're all very good), but he couldn't save the show by this time. The show was going down fast near the end of the 80's, and it was cancelled outright in 1989. Episodes like this hastened its downfall.",1

"Past version was superior!: I bought this cooling pad twice.First time was back in 2007. Very, very sturdy and well made. Quality plastic was used. No flex whatsoever. Unfortunately I lost it 8 months ago by misplacing it, so decided to buy it again.The second time I bought it was April 2011. All I can say is WOW, OMG!!! Super cheap plastic, and the flex was unreal. Plastic started cracking within the first 3 days. Returned it ASAP.The model they make now is so cheap and flimsy, not worth $5. The older version was well worth the $30 I paid for it.My opinion, keep looking.",1
"It Worked For Me...: A very thought-provoking and enlightening work on gender differences and how they conspire to prevent/hobble quality relationship between men & women. I found myself continually clapping my forehead and saying ""Duh!"" and I've always fancied myself an evolved, hip and sensitive new-age guy!With that said, I'm eager to ""reality check"" this book with some of my women friends to get their perspective. My instinct tells me ""We Have to Talk"" can be an incredibly valuable tool in understanding the deep, social underpinnings of both interpersonal communication and relational behavior. In fact, this may have been the single best interpersonal or ""relationship"" book I've ever read...and I've read a few. I now feel much better-equipped now to build stronger, healthier and more mutually-rewarding relationships in the future.I also got the sense the authors really know their stuff and commend them for presenting the issue and information in a clear,very readable style.",2
"Hmmm...: I agree with Luke Magnus 100%.The Tea Party were a inovative, unique and powerful band. I was hooked the moment I first heard Splendor Solis and my admiration and appreciation grew with their next two albums. Seeing them play live was truly amazing.With all their releases up to and including Transmission, we were hearing beautifully crafted music unaffected by standard pop music parameters and ideology.My heart broke when I first heard Triptych and nothing since has helped to heal it. What indeed did happen? 7 Circles is another example of lazy lyrics and songs which seem to be born out of a desire for Radio airplay rather than the desire to stimulate the senses. It is as if the band has conceeded that they must appeal to a broader audience in order to sell records. What a shame.I live in hope that The Tea Party will one day return to form.",1
"Great movie, great acting: This is Elia Kazan's first film, so any flourishes of cinematic style (not something he's particularly known for anyway) are very spare. That allows the acting to shine--and the acting is amazing, supported by a terrific script from a series of newspaper articles that weren't written as a dramatic structure. The sparingness of the environments in the film highlights the stark situation this family is in, and the father and kids (and aunts) optimism provides strong contrast to Dorothy McGuire's BEST performance (and first film!). Her arc in the film is powerful, and is represented visually in a straightforward way that NEVER gets in the way of the story. The emotional release at the end is almost overwhelming.",2

"re. comments by Pat of Westland MI: I read this book and liked it for a lot of the same reasons already shared by others here. So I'll limit this to correcting a comment by Pat of Westland MI. He states that some of the Zanders' work is informed by Landmark Education concepts, and that that influence is not acknowledged in The Art of Possibility. I don't know exactly what Landmark Education is, but I did see it acknowledged in their book---in, yes, the ""Acknowledgements"" pages at the end of the book!",2
"The game is not playable: This game was not even close to being ready for release. Consider the following: 1) Servers are not up for more than 20 minutes at a stretch in prime time. 2) Lag in the cities is about as bad as it gets. If you don't have a cable modem, forget it. 3) Many bugs leave characters stuck in zones and unable to move, stuck in shops, stuck in missions. 4) Funcom does not provide phone support. The only way to get help is via e-mail or to /petition in game. I have yet to receive a reply to either method.Save your money. There are other games coming out soon that are worth waiting for. (Shadowbane, Horizons, and Dark Age of Camelot are all in Beta.) Also, both Everquest and Asheron's Call do not experience any of the problems listed above. They are both stable and cost a LOT less.Save your money on this one, it's simply not playable at present.",1

Good Quality: Affordable and attractive for hanging swords or guns. Easy to hang on the wall or stand on a solid surface.,2
"Disappointment: I was excited to read this when all the hype started. I usually love fantasy books especially ones about vampires.Sadly, I could not finish the book. It's horribly written and catered to mainly 12 yr old girls. I found the characters unlikeable, shallow and superficial, especially ""Bella"" who doesn't give a damn about you unless you happen to be the most gorgeous guy on the planet. And how many times was Stephanie gonna mention that he ""dazzles"", give me a break...Poor writing with weak plot.I'm saddened how many copies this has sold when there are so many better and original authors out there.",1
"Good book: I just got done reading this book and I loved it. I liked Jane's Warlord better, but it was good. It was different and I did not read the first book in the series (did not know there was one, but its in an anthology anyway). So, I had to get used to the different worlds, but once I got past that, I highly enjoyed it.",2
"One Important Fact Left Out: This product does not work as described, not for me anyway. Here is my important fact: One must be strong with good dexterity. Use the hand guard as you place the potato on the slicer and hold it with one hand as you use the other hand to tilt the slicer up on one end, then attempt to push the potato down the slicer while keeping it tilted and through the coarse blade which has been adjusted to its widest possible setting. If the potato doesn't fall off or you drop it and you accomplish the slicing, you will find that it has sliced your 'fries' into french fry shaped hash browns. The adjustment did not go any wider so we fried them anyway and ate potato sticks.",1
Classic for some: This was a present for my significant other. He loved it. We have watched Season 1 together. I had never seen this show before. The content is not for the kindler or gentler PC minded folks - but if you can laugh at someone's ignorance then this is worth the money.,2
"Great deal for those who like terrible movies: The only thing worse than Ben Affleck's taste in screenplays these days, is the public who supports this schlock. ""Armageddon"" and ""Pearl Harbor"" did not require an ounce of originality to make, and will demand zero thought of the viewer. If that's what you're looking for -- and a lot of people are -- then you're in luck.",1
"A treasure of a book!: Wow! Who would have thought that a children's book about the Holocaust could be so wonderfully done? Lowry creates a picture of real life during the German occupation of Denmark, one rich with clever characterization and true emotion. The story, told primarily from a child's perspective, is akin to To Kill A Mockingbird in its vision and detail. The story creates an atmosphere where any reader can imagine what it must have been like for people during this unbelievable time in history.",2
"first timer: I'm a 16 year old girl who has had sweat rings since the end of 8th grade. I mostly sweat perfusivily when I am nervous, which is a majority of the time since I'm extremely shy. But I also sweat just sitting on my couch. The rings can get really big sometimes and it's extremely embarassing. It is my second day trying Certain Dri: yesterday it didn't work, but tonight as I put it on I actually felt itching and burning, unlike yesterday. So I believe I did something wrong the first day. The itching is somewhat intense considering I have sensitive skin, but I feel like it just may work. I'm hoping so because I have no other alternitive.",2
"BLUE CHRISTMAS: I haven't figured out why so many artists (particularly contemporary Christian ones) want to do Christmas songs as relics from the big band era. Not that I have anything against that wonderful period of music, trying to breathe life into traditional carols by ""big banding"" them has gotten tired. First, Russ Taff, Kathy Troccoli, and now Clay Crosse. It's not that they are bad, but if you already have a good collection of holiday cd's, this one offers nothing new. Crosse's voice is so obviously effected, he loses the heart and the spirit of these songs. Nice try, Clay, but listen to Steven Curtis to understand how to really make a good Christmas album.",1
"It's ALL GOOD.: LOVE IT! As a New Yorker, this sound is really representative of all the influences, beats and rhythms of a soundscape and place we call NUEVA YORK. Even on the cover, you got buildings as STEREO's - it's an urban sound that I think translates worldwide! My favorites are ""Oye Mira"", ""Cruisin'"", ""Take it Easy"", and ""All Good Things"" (next single, anybody?) - but really this is an album you will play through to the end and just chill!",2
"Good for low impact workout: I ordered this because I wanted to get a mile walk in everyday but don't have a good area outdoors to do so. I have bad knees, making a lot of the exercise videos difficult for me to do - I have the biggest loser workout for Kinect and find it frustrating because of all the exercises that are bad for my knees - but this is low impact and still gives you a good workout. I'm not in the best of shape, so I've stuck with the first walk, but there are three more that get gradually more intense. Bob instructs the first walk, Simone the second, Bob the third, Tara the fourth. There's also a cool down at the end with Tara and Simone. I've done Walk Away The Pounds in the past and I would consider this comparable but I think this walk goes more quickly - it's not boring.",2

"Turns out this is a $2.50-per-use disposable thermometer.: When I bought this thermometer I really wasn't interested in the ""programmable"" features. It's not that complicated. Stick probe in meat. Watch for target temperature to be reached. Remove meat from oven. And this unit accomplished that just fine, chirping when the desired temperature is reached.The reason I bought this was to monitor temperatures without opening the oven door, pure and simple. And that's what it does -- but only for about 12 roastings, in my case, before it stopped giving an accurate reading. And not just slightly off, but wildly wrong. Busted. I've trashed it and gone back to my old fashioned, reliable, not programmable, open the oven door and peek inside, meat thermometer. Oh well.",1
"Awesome book for young adults: On this book's website I read several passages from within it, and those alone helped me get motivated. If only I had the money, I would definitely purchase this book.",2
"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!: I have to say that these earbuds look great in the package. After my standard iPod earphones stopped working I shopped around for a replacement. I like the in-ear style headphones because they are discreet. These looked great, they were even white.The first thing I noticed after opening them was the odd cord configuration. The cord is split unevenly allowing the cord for one earbud to wrap around the back of your neck to the other ear. The problem is that the cord splits too early leaving a dangling cross section right under your left ear. This tugs on the earbuds which fit horribly.Yes, they look great but they do not fit in my ears whatsoever; I even tried both attachments. At first I just thought that I was unlucky and my ears are shaped weird... but that's not the case. Every review seems to have the same conclusion: they don't fit.I will say that they sound great when I hold them up to my ears... but, don't waste your money.",1
Very good movie: My seven year old son and I both enjoyed the movie. There are a lot of good and funny characters that keep you entertained from beginning to end.,2
"Gritty, raunchy, and gripping: The first book was a bit unsettling. Kildar continues in that vein, but the action and characters grab you and keep you in the seat until it's over.Definately not recommended for children or the thin-skinned. Very strong language and graphic violence are throughout the book. Some scenes are designed to revolt the reader, but if you're looking to get your jollies, look elsewhere.",2
"Very basic, incomplete and cautiously useful for the novice: By the title, I assumed that you could find the meaning of most shlokas based on hindu philosophy. Wrong! I have been trying to use it for the last three months and never found any word or phrase that I was actually looking for. For those totally unaware of Hindu philosophy it may be cautiously useful. The author has tried to be thorough, but it is apparent he does not understand the Hindu philosophy in his bones. Put another way, he has a lot of ""book knowledge,"" but nothing deeper, which clearly shows in his descriptions of words and phrases. Generally disappointing!",1
"flatware beware: I found the flatware to be light weight, cheap feeling and looking, and doubt it is durable. Big disappointment.",1
"This novel was well written and fun, and I recommend it.: Tia sets out to discover who sent her an atrocious black valentine, convinced that it must be one of the couples whose marriage she had a hand in. On her journey, she comes near to being abducted many times, and also learns a lesson in love from her cousin. She attempts to right the troubles in several couples' relationships, only to find herself in trouble with love. When she finds out that her uncle is involved in a nefarious kidnapping plot and meets the plan's adversary, she is caught upin a whirl of emotion. But, I can't give away the rest, so suffice it to say that this novel should definitely be on your list. It is entertaining and intelligently written. I recommend you read this book and find out how Tia's heart troubles are resolved!",2
"Soft Fabric And Lovely Color: I got the Smokey Blue Queen sheets and Love them. I've had the sheets for about a week so I don't know how they'd fare in the long run, but they seem very sturdy so far. The color compliments the rest of my bedroom decor which is a cherry dark brown with lots of warm beige and crisp white colors and florals. I tend to buy more breathable cotton so I don't look for a higher thread count. These sheets are just breathable enough, but the thread count lends a more luxurious almost silky feel. I didn't feel any of the itch that I read about in the other reviews. The sheets feel a bit crisp, and I'm sure with a few more washes they'll probably being to get even more soft, like cotton often does.",2
"my god gordon: Mike Gordon never disappoints in anything he is involved in. This DVD is no exception. The movie is so funny.....it can't be categorized. Just so much dead pan humor in it that it drives me crazy. If you are a fan of surreal movies or a Mike Gordon afficianado then this DVD is for you. The short included , ""Gubernatorial Cribbage"" is alone worth buying the DVD version. Probably one of my favorite movies.!!",2

"Gift type book of select passages from Conversations w/God: This is a book of excerpts from various ""Conversations With God"" Series books. There are ten chapters of 'meditations' which includes brief passages on different topics. For example, the 'Mediations on Feelings' contains topics on the subjects of truth, love & fear, grief and anger and etc. The passages vary in length from a few lines to a couple of small paragraphs, and there are black & white pictures adjacent to the passages.This is nice for what it is, which is a gift type book. It's something you could pick up now and again and get a little dose of inspiration, or something to think on. If you have read and liked CWG books, you'll most likely enjoy this.",2
"A tedious polemic and waste of time: Only 10 years old and it already seems outdated, this sort of peevish crankiness from spoiled academics complaining about the idiot conversations going on in their subsidized ivory towers is an affront to every inhabitant of the real world. It is astonishing the waste of intellectual energy the baby boom generation has indulged in.The only portion of the book I found slightly worth the trouble was the section on the Goddess-hype in anthropology, which allowed me to indulge my mild curiousity in the subject without having to wade into volumes of feminist cant; but if you wanted to actually be the least informed about any subject, this isn't the place to look.",1

She can dance about as well as the average woman, sing maybe a little better, but only since she had voice training for Evita, and as for acting, we'd better not go there.

"This was so disappointing: Son Of A Wanted Man is the first audio book I've ever listened to and I was so disappointed with it! I was hoping to hear the story as Mr. L'Amour intended it to be - as he wrote it. Instead, it's a lot of bad ""character acting"" and ridiculous sound effects. It completely detracts from the story. Please tell me that not all of the audio books are like this!Beau L'Amour should be ashamed of himself for ruining his father's work this way. It truly is awful. The voices don't fit the characters and they certainly don't convey the personalities of the characters.My father taught me to read with Louis L'Amour books. Mustang Man was my first. I've been reading his books for almost 40 years now and I can't express enough how disappointing this audio book was. I sincerely hope they are not all this way.",1

"You know it has to be great....: when you open up the liner notes. Come on, any cd that has a cut-out liner has potential. A big fan of bands like Neutral Milk Hotel, Decembrists, all the way to Flogging Molly and Sondre Lerche, I was intrigued by the lyrics- the music makes them everything they could be. ""Pink Bullets"" is an amazing work, and probably the best song on the cd- though ""Gone for Good"" is terrific, too. Actually, every song on the cd is well-worth whatever you spend, so check it out. Very seldom do you find a band or a cd that has a consistently good album without a downside- take advantage of an artistic rarity!",2
"Worst ever...: I have ordered this movie for Christmas to watch with my kids and wisely decided to preview it... I am glad I did- what a senseless, vulgar and tasteless movie! I could not make it even through the first 15 minutes, complete waste...",1
"Fascinating account of truly clever detective work: Friedman succeeds brilliantly in this effort to peel back the layers of what we now know as Torah or Pentateuch. What is uncovered is a complex interplay between early Jewish communities and their respective leaders, how their differing interests powered the production of varied written accounts, and the forces that finally wove them together into a single rich narrative tapestry. The book reads like a compelling detective novel, while respecting readers' abilities to process the available information for themselves.",2
"WHY? DRM? WHY?: Software makers, Music publishers, Movie Producers - GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEADDRM does not work and only hurts the honest consumer. Most people who are going to steal this game were not going to buy it in the first place. DRM does not make a thief honest!Please remove the DRM!",1

"What a poor recording!: This recording is a ADD Mono remastered recording of music recorded from 1947 to 1950. I suppose there is merit in listing to the Stokowski Symphony Orchestra conducted by Stokowski himself. However, I was looking for an excellent HiFi listening CD using current technology and not remastering of old, mono recorded music. Chandos 9259 is a much better recording of some of the same Bach music (certainly not a 1:1 match). Probably the best ever recording of Bach transcriptions is the Chandos recording of Leonard Slatkin's transcriptions.",1
"A Good Overview of Stylish Storage Solutions: Alhtough some of the photos may not have been previously published, this book is a pictorial overview of various stylish storage solutions from projects that have been seen in ""House Beautiful"" magazine. Any repeats are worthwhile in this helpful book, however, that ranges from the simple but classic library in the last home of legendary decorator Nancy Lancaster to the stark utilitarian dressing room/closet in the New York loft of designer Bruce Bierman. Work by interior designers Bunny Williams, Christian Badin, David Anthony Easton, Tom Fleming, Mariette Himes Gomez and Mario Buatta are shown along with architects Hugh Newell Jacobsen, Peter Pennoyer, and John Tackett, among many others. Not a ""How To"" book, but rather an inspiration for storage throughout the house.",2
""" A Must Have"" for the Bruce Lee fan: I was not disappointed at all with the transfer of this classic to hd-dvd. I was very impressed with the color and crispness and the audio surprised me as well! This is a must have for the die-hard Bruce Lee fan and a casual fan of the genre will not be disappointed as well. A huge Bruce Lee fan all my life i can't wait for the release of his other movies in hd-dvd or blu-ray.",2
Sizes run small: Size smaller than expected. Purchased as Christmas gift for nephew; plan on returning.,1
Excellent source of info for emerging literacy.: This is one of the main texts we use in our emerging literacy course in our university's graduate reading program. It is an excellent source of information regarding how children learn to read and about the role language development plays in literacy development. I highly recommend this book.,2
"LOVED THIS BOOK!: The long awaited sequel to ""Torah Rediscovered - Challenging Centuries of Misinterpretation and Neglect"". The Berkowitzes have done it again, with their gracious style of teaching and their loving approach, they demonstrate the beauty, symmetry, majesty and graciousness of the Torah, and then show the non-Jewish reader how they have Divine permission to embrace it for themselves, to become full participants in an inheritance with the Jewish people, Land and Scriptures. By the way, ""Torah Rediscovered"" is currently out of print, but it too is an absolutely must read book... Tremendous reading.",2
"Totally creepy - in a completely absorbing way . . .: PERFUME reads like a grotesque fairy tale - but you can't put it down! If you have a taste for the bizarre AND a well-written novel, give it a try. But you've got to be able to stomach a little ickiness . . .",2
"GREAT CAST AND HISTORY WASTED...: Great cast and history were wasted the the director's heavy hand in conducting this movie. THe narrative is slow and boring, although the general plot is so good. Sad..",1
"Excellent: I am an avid collector of cake and pastry cookbooks, and this is by far the best one in my collection. The instructions have been defined in detail and are very easy to follow. The cakes I tried turned out beautifully and were much completemented on by my guests. This is a must for anyone with a passion for baking, decorating or with a passion for chocolate and its history.",2
"Press Play: Sean really seems to relish his role as a tough-guy ex-con in this intense caper from the early 70s that holds up nicely. The conceit that everything we're seeing and hearing is culled from various surveillance tapes is a little distracting and doesn't quite work. But Lumet's brisk, no-nonsense take on the action when the heist goes live still delivers. Good NYC locations and Qunicy Jones jazzy score help. The punch card type of the credits and those awful ""futuristic"" sounding, echoing computer beeps on the soundtrack are what make the picture seem much more dated than it is. Plus Lumet's inclusion of more than a few gay caricatures.It's fun to see Chris Walken's debut and Dyan is sensationally sexy. Only Alan King's irritating over-acting mars the cast.",2
"sorry i didnt write much more about how much this book sucs: Lets put it this way Kube-Mcdowell wrote 3 different books with no endings. Lukes looking for mum and i never understood how he hooked up with the white current girl. Landos off on some ship, i never understood why. and leias holding the new republic together against the ""huge threat"" of the yevetha i mean jeez how could anyone write a more shocking book? And as for 1 of those great spellbinding usual excellent last 2 chapters of star wars books poof nothings there.This book is hollow shallow and boring.and if Kube-Mcdowell reads this you made me spend money on a bad book (although your other books are usually good.",1
"First it hurts, then it makes you sick...: This is quite possibly the worst book I've ever read in my life.I didn't realize someone could create something so self-congratulatory that they lost any and all vision of contradiction. There are examples of 'great architecture', complete with content hierarchy diagrams, that were obviously poorly thought out, if thought about at all. Common problems like separating support and marketing information, or placing/labeling company wide information have no formal identification or treatment.Essentially this is a tour of 'sexy' sites made in 1998 - which wasn't really that much of a break through year for usability or architecture. If you want to see what happened when a mass of CDROM designers started making websites - this is the read for you...Personally, I stole this book from the office just to ensure that some producer wouldn't read it and take it seriously... It's that nonsensical.",1
"Now these hippies could rock!!: Sure they looked shaggy and had facial hair that was a little ragged, but don't forget, it was the 70's, man!! Everyone was doing it!!As for the actual music, this band couldn't be beat. I wish these guys would sit down with some of today's tone deaf artists and teach them how to write a genuine melody. Or maybe that can't be taught. Well, if not, then at least show them a good guitar hook or two.CCR just had everything: a bear of a singer, catchy tunes that are in no way too poppish, and a sort of folksy electric guitar that seemed to go with the flow. Just listen to the album and see how many fun rock songs you recognize.Hey, they may have been hippies, but you shouldn't hold that against them!!! Like I said, it was the 70's - everyone acted that way!!Long live CCR, a band that makes Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young look like total stoners!!HAVE A GOOD ONE!!",2
"Awful crap: We can't believe this load of crap was called Star Wars for the ninties! Three of us were watching it. One fell asleep as the other two watched a ridiculous plot with annoying as hell characters unfold. If you have insomnia, this movie is recommended but if you vomit frequently, don't watch it!",1
"Dave Ramsey's advice is completely unrealized: When Dave Ramsey can live off of $24,000.00 a year, and have a family, then perhaps I can listen to him. His advice of paying for everything in cash starts off great.However, I believe in putting my family first. That does not include getting two or three jobs to pay off debt, and make my family suffer; no way! Dave claims to be a religious man, and if that were the case, he would realize that the Bible says that family comes before the love of money (as well as a few other things)And finally, the man makes hundreds of thousands a year. I just can't follow the words of someone who does that and expects normal people to live.",1

"Kiddie Razor: I bought this for my 2 yo nephew. He always tried to ride the bigger ones but they were too heavy for him. This one is perfect!! Since the tools you need to put it together are included (along with storage of the tools on the Razor itself)putting it together was a snap. He didnt have to wait long to get to ride. Tough product, looks great, and has the Razor name...what else do you need???",2

"great product!: Splitting maul and Fiskars knife sharpener really works for me.I was looking for a substitute for my old go-devil maul and 14 pounder monster maul and I did when searching on you-tube for some differant ideas. I saw on you-tube a splitting competition from Finland and I was sold. The Maul is much lighter which means more precise and longer hours at work. I have been splitting ten footers by 7""dia with this maul then I cut with chain saw. This makes carrying the 10 footer easier out of the woods to my shed instead of carrying blocks of wood at a time. I have also used a 6 lbs Trojan for splitting but I think the Fiskars is better. I can also use the maul for hitting wedges when cutting trees since I do tree work for a living.",2
"Very buggy, not ready - don't buy: OK... I have NIS 2004, and I had NIS 2003 before that.I have spent over 16 hours attempting to install this software.I've talked to their tech support people 5 times after wait times of 1 hour, 45m, 1 1/2 hours, 2 1/2 hours and 1 hour.They don't understand what you are saying, seriously, I have never repeated my email address so many times in my life.Each person spends 2 to 3 minutes with you, tells you they know what your problem is, then tells you they will send you an email with easy to follow instructions. They do (and trust me, after the long wait, you are really crossing your fingers that they have your email address right!) and you can follow the instructions. But one problem just leads to another, and BANG you are on the phone with tech support again.I had NIS 2004, and it worked fine, I wish now, I had just paid the subscription fee, and not upgraded. What a huge, waste of time mistake.",1
Ring my bell: I purchased this for my 10 year old daughters bedroom door. She was constantly asking us to knock before coming into her room especially after showering or changing clothes.

"misleading: If you read this book in order to understand goth that is not what you will get. This book is strongly biased against the goth movement (or whatever you want to call it) and frankly, it reads like something written for hysterical parents who are afraid their kids are goths or will be goths and we just can't have that can we? I bought this book and returned it.",1
"Can't wait to see if theres a third book in the series....: Koontz does a wonderful job of keeping the reader guessing. He keeps the pages turning in ""Sieze the Night"" by adding a ton of mystery to a very scary story line. I hope that Koontz can find a way to use Christopher Snow's character in at least one more novel. To end the saga now would be a shame. For those of you that are Dean Koontz fans try this book on it will keep you wondering and guessing.",2
"Worry cure: Robert Leahy's book is well written and backed by sound research. It gives direct and clear instruction on what you can do. While acknowledging that each person is complex and ""one size fits all solutions"" won't work. After reading this book however I sometimes ask myself if the cure isn't as bad as the disease.",1
"Cuisnart Chefs Classic: I'm very well pleased with this set.Although this is not the set that i wanted,but is the set that I could afford.And after useing it for awhile it is far better than alot of sets on the market today.The pans heat evenly and quicky,and the handles do stay cool.The lids fit better than most sets do.I believe that this set will last a long time if taken care of.",2
"Very bad enamel: First time I used this Dutch Oven, I found the enamel flaked off. I used a wooden spoon, temperature never exceeded 350 degrees, it wasn't dropped, yet the enamel is gone; I wonder who ate that ;-(.Very, very disappointing. Of course, when I ordered it, it was back ordered and when it finally arrived, after the Christmas holidays, I didn't have a need to use it until recently (after the return window closed). This made in China Lodge Dutch Oven is a big waste of your money. Don't order it.",1
"See the movie: I kept thinking that this book would make a good screenplay. It did not make a good book. Nicholas Sparks has some good, though simple, ideas for a plot. Problem is: he can't write. This book is better suited in the junvenile section of a library where an author's ability to use detail to enhance a story does not matter. His publisher has done a great job selling Sparks. Perhaps they can find him a better editor to improve his writing.",1

Cheaply made: Upon opening product we found that the large containers were stuck together so tightly that they could not be separated. After soaking in hot soapy water we were able to separate them but not before marking all containers and cracking one. Lids are difficult to attach to all size containers and seals are poor. Carousel is a bit difficult to assemble due to poor quality.I suppose the good points are that these are imported (guess from where) and arrived in a timely fashion.Do not recommend.,1
"Really good tone for the price: This thing really sounds good. I'm using it with a PA and the results are pretty nice.What I really missed when it arrives was the power supply, I had to by an universal 9 volts power supply and there is almost no noise (apart from my bass).Solid product totally recommended!",2
"STINKY pills - dogs hate the smell. No noticeable improvement.....: I rescued a female German Shepherd dog about 6 months before buying this product. When she first came home, it became evident there was a problem. Our vet diagnosed her with incontinence - which is surprisingly common for spayed female GSDs. She is on medication, but still occasional leaks. We bought these vitamins, and after using up the bottle was disappointed.The other negative is the smell. They REEK - I didn't even like touching them. My dog HATED the taste & would often try to spit it out.Wouldn't recommend.",1
"not replicant: when I rented this movie I thought it would have been as good as his last direct-to-video replicant. But it was really lame. I wish that Van damme would choose his movies bettter because I want to see him in the theaters where he should be.If you like Van damme as much as I do rent this before you buy it. It isn't nearly as good as Hard target,Maxmium risk,Death warrent, desert heat, or replicant. This isnt worth anytime use it for another one of his movies instead.",1
"JUNK - A Sheep In Wolf's Clothing: Do not be fooled by the appearance (and substantial weight) of this tool. It looks like it would last a lifetime. Unfortunately, as the other reviews have noted, the mechanism is junk. This is by far the worst Black & Decker tool I have ever owned. The clutch/selector mechanism failed after 4 uses. I've had B&D tools that lasted for 20+ years. If this is the quality of tool that they are putting out now, I won't be buying another. If you buy this one, you will be sorry. I wouldn't pay $10 for it, as I'm not sure most users would finish their first job with it. Junk...Junk....Junk.",1
Boring...School book: This book was required for school. I read it through most of it and its very wordy and not much real content.,1

"Good printer, but MANGLES envelopes: I was really happy with the speed and quality of the printer until I tried to print an envelope. This printer does not have a straight-through output path for envelopes. Instead, they have to make a sharp turn inside the machine, which severely creases them, to the point of interfering with the printing.Take a look at the diagram of envelopes they don't support on page 15 of the manual, and you'll see a picture of every conceivable type of envelope. Bottom line: they don't support any, but aren't willing to admit it.I would be embarassed to send my letters out in envelopes looking like this. I returned the unit and got an HP 3390, which does envelopes perfectly. It's otherwise pretty much the same, but $250 more.",1
LifeSaver???: Let me start by saying that I've never been upside down in a submerged car trying to cut my seatbelt off and shatter the window to get out but if I was there are better safety hammers/tools on the market. This one is lightweight and reminds me of a toy. I'm afraid it would break before the window would. It does have a sharp point and cutting edge both untried by me. It just doesn't instill confidence. Look elsewhere and spend a little more for the real thing.,1
Nothing new: I was very disappointed with this book. Usually anything written by Tracey is motivating. Everything in this book was coined by someone else. Absolutely nothing new and a total waste of my money.,1

"Gustav Holst: Planets - The New Dimension of Sound Symphonic Series [7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio Disc] [BD25 Audio Only] [Blu-ray]: I am playing this on a Sony PS3.

The lower registers (bass) is very weak.",1
Great Tank Game!!!!!: I had been wanting a tank game for a while and steel reign was one of the ones I was considering on bying and its the one I bought. I also have ps2 but thre are not many tank games on ps2. Steel Reign is very cool. It has some cool tanks. I also think that the screeny is nice 2. The controls are fanstic and the graphics are very nice for being a ps1 game. The fram rate is also good. The game runs very smoothely. I do not know what else to say so I think I will end it at that. If you are looking for a tank game and only have ps1 or thre are no tank games that float your boat on another system you may have then bye steel reign.,2
"A little too wordy, but an overall good book: I never normally would have picked this book to read, but in my school there is the dreaded summer reading. The first three or four chapters go by very s-l-o-w-l-y and are very wordy. But to my surprise, the middle and end of the book end up actually very interesting. If you like books about real people and true stories, I'd definitley reccomend it to you.",2
"okkkay: If you have seen the movie, I recomend you not buying the soundtrack. I personally thought it bites. In the movie, there is all this cool rock music, but on the cd all there is ""music inspired by the film"", and it is not what I expected. I didn' like the music, I did think that one or two songs were ok. But the rest were boring (I don't mean to offend anyone who likes the type of music that was on the CD). I wish they would make a new soundtrack with better songs, and THAT WERE IN THE MOVIE!",1
Almost 5 stars: I really liked this cd with its upbeat tunes taht are awsome to dacne to. I would give the album at least a 4 for the songs lucky and satifaction. I would suggest buying it. And this is coming from someone who hates britney!,2
"Easy to enter, harder to leave.: Mean Girls: easy to enter, harder to leave...especially when the ending of this 2004 classic leaves you on the edge of your seat, wanting more. With a great story and an all-star cast, including such famed thespians as Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, and Tina Fey, it isn't a surprise that viewers wouldn't want this romance to end.Mean Girls tells the story of a previously home schooled student who has just arrived to town from the country of Africa. She is going to attend a high school in the country that she has just arrived, that is, North America, where she is to get socialized, that is, make friends.This magnificent love story is unlike any other. It is also one of my personal favorites, and a movie that I would highly recommend you see if you haven't.Mean Girls also contains tons of memorable scenes and quotes that really make it a treasure, and cause the movie to be remembered forever.",2
"Don't buy ""3-Pack"": The product itself performs satisfactory, but beware of the seller sending only 1 bottle, instead of the promised 3. After complaining, they sent a 2nd bottle...and after complaining again I was refunded $6 to my account for the never received 3rd bottle. I don't believe a 3-pack exists, but the seller assumes you will not bother to complain about getting only 1 bottle despite paying $20. They were wrong in my case. Hope this helps!",1

HE FINDS THESE TWO CRAZED, OUT OF THEIR MINDS, IDIOTS TO TRAIN AND HOPE THAT THEY DO RIGHT, BY HIM, IN HIS QUEST FOR REVENGE FOR THE KILLING OF HIS FAMILY. THE PICTURE QUALITY WAS GOOD. THE QUALITY OF THE STORYLINE WAS O.K. BUT THE MOVIE LACKS TRUE EXCITEMENT UNTIL THE END. THEY FIGHT AND ONCE THEY HAVE DEFEATED THE ENEMY, ONE PERISHES, LEAVING THE ONE WHO FOLLOWED TO CONTINUE ON. THIS MOVIE IS O.K. BUT I GIVE IT A 2 1/2 STARS. IT IS NICE FOR A COMEDY COLLECTION BUT NO BLOOD AND GUTS.",1
"Hits All the Highlights: This is a near-perfect two-and-a-half hour collection of one of the pop world's great singer-songwriters. You get seven tracks from his Seventies partnership with Jim Messina. [The only quarrel here is the exclusion of ""Thinking of You"" and the inclusion of the 2:26 single version of ""Angry Eyes,"" instead of the 7:40 album version.] From there you get all fourteen of Loggin's Top 40 solo hits, sampling all ten of his solo albums (excluding his holiday album)along the way. While there is nothing from his 1980 live album, you do get a terrific live version of ""What a Fool Believes"" with it co-writer Michael McDonald from the 1993 live album OUTSIDE: FROM THE REDWOODS. Loggins had some of the biggest hits of his career in the Eighties, especially with soundtrack songs like ""I'm Alright,"" ""Footloose"" and ""Danger Zone."" If you're looking for a solid overview of a stellar career, this is it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",2

Permatex Adhesive Bust!: I followed directions and the product did not work at all.I would not recommend it at all. A waste of my money.,1
"Waste of money!: We bought this guitar for my 10 year old son as a guitar to start him on. It was nothing but frustration for all of us. It is very poorly made, never tunes properly, and is all around junk. He is constantly irritated at the fact that even if he plays the chord correctly, it still sounds wrong. After questioning a nearby music store about this particular guitar the manager told me that they get at least 5 or 6 a month in for repairs that end up costing the same as the guitar did.Reasons for the ratings: This would have been so much more fun if it wasn't such bad quality. Sure a guitar has incredible educational value, just not this brand. It's like getting a lego set with warped bricks. Durable? I think I have already stated my case.You could consider this for a 3 year old to go crazy on, but it would be cheaper and more educational if you sat down with the tot and made a guitar out of a kleenex box and rubber bands.",1
"AWESOME AWESOME ENDOW ME BLESSING!!!: I HAVE NOT STOPPED PLAYING THIS SONG SINCE THE FIRST SECOND THAT I HEARD IT. This song is truly annointed by God. Thank God for the musical genius who put together the collaboration of Coko, Faith, Lil Mo & Fantasia. It has brought tears of joy and happiness into my life. GOD BLESS YOU GIRLS, KEEP PRAISING HIM AND HE WILL CONTINUE TO DIRECT YOUR PATH. I AM PRAYING THAT THIS SONG WILL SOON BE PERFORMED LIVE (HOPEFULLY ON THE CELBRATION OF GOSPEL OR SOMETHING).",2

El problema es cuando se regresa y la tierra que uno conoció de joven, ya no es la misma. Benedetti, consagrado poeta y novelista uruguayo nos transporta con esta novela a su terruño en unas circunstancias únicas, con pinceladas poéticamente presentadas, con dramas cuidadosamente estudiados, y personajes muy bien trabajados, con una entremezcla de recursos narrativos - prosa, poesía, epístolas, artículos periodísticos -, para hacer de este libro uno de los mejores ejemplos de la literatura latinoamericana que el Cono Sur nos ha entregado en los últimos años.",2
"poor quality, instructor is over the top, then dull,: the instructor seems rather unconvincing, she was over the top and then dull, i couldn't get a feel for her style, she rather annoyed me at time...the idea was great, and the moves were not bad, but the home set was poor, i didn't think the quality of this video was worthy of a good rating.",1
Best Clancy that I've read: This was the first Tom Clancy novel that I read. It was in 1984 and I was told that my ship ( USS Pharris FF-1094) was in the story. I couldn't put it down. Like all of his stories it grabbed me from the first page.,2
"... a disappointment: Lots of sizzle but no steak. Lost in incomprehensible talk about ""love"" and lots of other new-agey nonsense, this book reads like a transcribed audio ramble. It takes conversational to its ridiculous extremes and tries to make pretty basic marketing tenets sound somehow revolutionary and fresh.Useless exercises, laughable case studies and lots and lots of hype. I'd say it might impress you if you're a newbie, but I think even newbies are better served finding a good, solid book with real information. I say cut to the real deal and go straight to Free Agent Nation (which the author has obviously read) or some of the other fine books offered in this category. Skip this watered-down attempt at a how-to guide.",1

"EXCELLENT Diaper Disposal System!: We love the fact that we can use our tall kitchen garbage bags with our Diaper Champ instead of having to buy special refills like Playtex's Diaper Genie. Diaper smells are contained well. The capacity seems to be slightly larger than the Diaper Genie, too. (Less trips outside with bags of dirty diapers equals less work for Mommy and Daddy!) Wouldn't trade this diaper disposal system for any other! 5 stars!!!",2
"Rick Sebak Does It Again: I've enjoyed all of Rick Sebak's documentaries, but this is one of his best. I still think the hot dog one is the most interesting, and thematically coherent, but this one contains some nice discussion of the way that great sandwiches are true uniters.",2
"SOO disappointed..: They revamped the whole game, so even starting a quick game so Brady could throw a bomb to Moss was confusing. Once I got the game up, again they changed everything. Picking a play has changed. Change for the sake of changing as it didn't make it easier. Players are smaller, you can't change your view or the field, can't change audio settings, No Madden or Michaels or any intelligent play by play. In fact, one of the worst and poorly thought-out pieces is after you have picked your teams, Marshall Faulk comes on to give you his prediction. It is always canned, never smooth and always wrong. NE vs. Oak, he said ""this one won't be close, (long pause) Oak 34, (long pause) NE 10"". Game in NE. (I know I am a Pats fan, but this happened 4 times I played.) I have had the game for just one night but so far just really disappointing. This is what you get for product when you stop competition. I am going to see if I can find update rosters for past games. Yes, it is that bad.",1
"So good, you think you were there...: Listening to the natural sounds of the surf and sea birds with the stunning video, you get the feeling you are there...No question this DVD will wash the stress away and put you in the remote beach zone. The images and sounds so vivid that you will be relaxing on the beach in no time and can almost feel the warm ocean waves lapping at your toes.Like to get away to the beach but can't, start up this DVD with a rum punch and your on the beach.Highly recommended and cannot say enough.",2
"I don't like it in its orginal form, re-engineering required: I had to add a spacer to the sprinkler arm to prevent it from blowing out the ""hose"" end of the sprinkler. I sent Melnor photos of my re-engineering of their defective product but have yet to hear back from them. It is a fine sprinkler now but understand that if you purchase one you may have the same problem I had. If I could insert photos of the fix I would do so.",1
Eve 6 is a great band...: This is a great cd. All of the songs on here are wonderful especially 'promise' and 'on the roof again'. All of the songs have a catchy tune and are great to sing along to. Anyone would like this cd if you liked the other eve6 cd or any kind of punk music. Buy it!,2
"Very informative but dry reading.: This book explains in explicit detail the Civil War within Kentucky's borders. It explains Kentucky's importance as a strategic military buffer state for both the North and South. The Civil War in Kentucky explores the underlying political strife that shaped and piloted the Civil War in Kentucky. It touches on the effects this war had on ordinary citizentry. I liked the detailed and little known information included in this book. It gave the background behind many commonly known facts within the state. It was an interesting touch when Dr. Harrison added well selected quotes to backup his facts. However, I thought the book was extremely dry reading. It was difficult to get through the book.",1
Disappointing: I really like John Astin. This movie fails in the writing and not the acting (provided you like Mr. Astin.),1
"The Adventures of Robin Hood: Book was written in an 'old english' language and very difficult to read and understand. Otherwise the book was interesting, but I got so frustrated that I didn't finish it.",1
"Band is too small!: I love this watch, it looks nice, it goes with everything. The only downside is that the watch band is so small. I am a small framed woman and can barely fit it to the second to last notch. I do not recommend this watch if you have average sized wrists or above.",2
"the worst: This is by far the worst vacuum I've ever owned, it's heavy, unconfortable, very hard to maneuver and worst of all no suction. I regret spending so much for it.",1
"""GOOD MELANCHOLY INTIMATE JAZZ VOCAL'S"": ""SLOWLY,I OPEN MY EYES,HAZY WITH MIST. SLOWLY MY LIPS REALIZE THEY HAVE BEEN KISSED."" Bobby Scott'svocal&piano; solo on this song,is the very best from the cd! He's recorded upclose with his husky,whisper vocal style with a few slurring of the words from time to time,still does justice to the lyrics.I first heard him sing ( from this cd.)""You turn the tables on me."" on KJAZ in 1991: When I hear that piano introto this tune,I know I'm going to hear one of my favorite cuts from this album. Besides the voice,he's a finepiano soloist. ""Hi Lily Hi Lo"" He tries to put a positive spin on the song,""Probably I'll fall in love again."" (It's,uptempo.)Some of the other songs are;""Am I blue?""(check ,the piano solo.) ,""When I fall in love"",""Jean""+5 more good ones. There's lots of melancholy here. Good bass,guitar,drums performed by some old pro's.Scott died 8 months(cancer.) after this recording. a final tribute to this talented musician,composer,arranger.",2
"Excellent Book about the opinions of scientists: Unlike the other reviewer who missed the point of the book, the authors were only reflecting the views of the scientists questioned. There is no attempt to prove the existence of God. The book is well written, with high ranking scientists from several fields providing valuable insight into their beliefs.",2
"Efficient and Handy: A nice surprise. Handy and convenient with ease of use by slipping in and out of charger. Equal between bare floor or carpet, always seems to contain more particles then I would have imagined. For best use much be emptied and filter cleaned after each use.",2
"an amazing read: I am a kingergarten teacher, and I learned so much from this book. It was amazing cover to cover. Every teacher should read this book, this man has the teaching motivation and philosphy that all teachers should have! Teach what you love, create excitement and sucess in your students. Also if you want to learn more about project approach, this is it. I love this book.",2
"Awful DVD edition: I think the movie is great but this DVD Edition really is ufuwl no extras at all and no DTS, its safe to say that in the near future it will come a ""Special Edition DVD"" or ""Collectors Edition"" or ""The Ultimate Edition"" or something like that, so if you really like this movie like I did, just wait a couple of months to buy a better edition.",1
Best show ever!!: Seriously best show ever. Such amazing acting. I watched all the episodes within a week. Just rewatched it again. Can't wait for it to come back!,2
"Great Book, Enormous amount of useful information: I used this book while completing both my Bachelor (Economic Crime Investigation, Security concentration) and Masters (Information Assurance)degrees. With Phishing scams on the rise, and more and more people falling victim to these scams, this book is a ""must read"" for anyone who is concerned with their identities. Phishing scams are not going away anytime soon, and Vines does a great job of teaching the reader what to look for to avoid becoming a victim and providing information that is current and real-world.",2
"Putt Putt Moon: Exciting game for kids to let their imagination unfold. It provides a sense of suspense in the child's mind as they play, for they don't know what's gonna be next in the game. It's fun!!",2
"Weir Paints a Powerful and Intriguing Picture: I you live in the Dallas area, the presence of the mafia might come as a surprise. It is widely assumed that this was a problem limited to the New York or Chicago area. There was some mention of organized crime in the early 60's surrounding the assination of JFK, otherwise, it doesn't generate much local publicity. A transplant from New York, Weir has obviously done his research. I found the book to be accurate as to the geography for the time period, and the action kept the pages turning. As the suburbs of Dallas have grown to become cities in their own right, it is extremely interesting to read the account of how Grapevine, Texas and Flower Mound, Texas were involved. I enjoyed ""City To Die For"" and would recommend it to my friends.",2
"Not Amazing: Readers were enthralled by this Kindergarten book, just because it won the Booker Prize, run by SHOPKEEPERS. The language used is absolutely childish and maybe readers understand abused usage of English lingo. I would say, and I know that Booker Prize is very controversial. There is one South African Writer who keeps getting this politicized so called prize. Anyway she failed as a screenwriter and learned the ropes of getting a Booker and in the process made her a millionare. I'm sorry even Kindergarten kids laugh at the sentence structure, syntax, world play---which one reviewer calls ""Jazzy"".It sure is Jazzy as no good writer can write so badly.",1
Childhood memories galore!: This is definitely porch swing reading! It brought back so many memories for me! Life was so simple and sweet growing up in the south. These lovely ladies through their delightful writings took me back to a happy pleasant time. I hope they continue to publish their thoughts and poetry. I finished the book in an afternoon and have read it again.,2
"Brilliant Movie - Poor DVD: Serves me right for not checking the viewer reviews first! I absolutely love this movie and gave away my VHS version after I ordered the DVD. So, I *still* have 4:3 screen format, not the Widescreen format I was so looking forward to. Focussing on ""content"" only would be misleading for DVD buyers, Amazon, and I'm tempted to return it. Subtract three stars for a really irritating studio decision.",1
Latvian Dictionary: The dictionary arrived in a timely fashion and was in excellent condition. I would not hesitate to order from the seller in the future.,2
"A must read for anyone remotely interested in codes!: I have always been fascinated by codes and Singh has put together a comprehensive book on the history of codes. Having read many books on codes, Singh was still able to enthrall me with some historical stories that I had not come across. It's not just technical stuff, but is written with the novice in mind as well. But the book holds enough technical information to keep the enthusiast interested as well. The version I bought has a crypt contest in the back, which I enjoyed working on - I was only able to solve the first 3 or so puzzles, but it was a lot of fun.",2
"One of the worst...: This has to be one of the worst friday the 13th movies ever made. It ranks as the 2nd worst on my list The worst being Jason goes to hell. The problems with this movie would have to be the lame story, the lame characters, too much female nudity(not enough male), and finally too much swearing. I wouldn't waste my time with this video unless you're a true Jason fan. And even then, you'll be disapointed.",1
"it is true: I have not received my purchase yet so far after I ordered it one month ago. I think I am cheated. And I have reflected it to the Amazon website. However, I have not gotten any answers. Therefore, I hope that everyone does not trust this man any more...... Now, I do not know how to deal with it yet. What I can do is just waiting for the answer from the Amazon Website.",1
"Get Paid to Shop, Eat & More!: ""You get what you pay for"" The information was nothing new. It had some good points and summaries. I would not put this publication on the top of my best buys list.",1
Duro-Med sloping coccyx cushion: It doesn't slope much i.e. it feels like the cushion is the same thickness in front as the back when sitting on it. It's too small for my tush. Can my tush be that big?,1
funny idea: I bought this as a stocking stuffier. This broke very fast and its not meant for people with big hands.,1
PC Magazine Guide to Home Networking: This book is way ahead of its times. I consider myself techy but there were things I learned from reading this guide that was entirely new knowledge for me. It speaks of the convergence of the digital world as we expect it to be. In my opinion the guide was very well researched and worth every cent spent.,2
This should be required reading.: Magnificent contemporary historic work. Every page an encyclopedia of facts. We are coming upon the 50th Anniversary of John F. Kennedy. This should be required reading.,2
"As pictured.: I purchased this case to house my graphic design portfolio boards. While it's the size I needed for all the work I wanted to show, it is a little large to carry around town if you have to tote it to an interview or whatever. If you can get away with it, I'd recommend either the 11 x 17 x 1"" box (this one is 2"" deep) or I'd go down to the 11 x 14 size. That said, I'm still using it and it works fine. Does scratch very easily, but once you get over it, it's not a big deal. Makes a bit of a loud sound when you open it, and then you have to set the lid on the table if you're presenting your portfolio to someone. Probably just best as a storage box, which mine will be relegated to soon. It will be perfect for that. Good buy.",2
Lacking in bird spirits: I come to my power animal through a syncretic shamanistic practice of sage-burning and arriving at a trance-like state playing my recorder (homemade from bamboo with stone implements). My power animal is a condor however THERE IS NO CONDOR WISDOM in this book. I would not rely on it as a 100% true guide to power animals HOWEVER IT IS AN OKAY INTRODUCTION. I like the animal drawings...mostly.,1
"A wonderful, captivating love story.....: I absolutely loved this book! It captured my interest from the very beginning and as the story developed, I had more and more difficulty putting it down. It is one of those books that you just don't want to end because you get so caught up in the characters. I am excited to read the sequel, ""The Elusive Flame.""",2
"Bad Tripod Heads: Bought four (4) of them. The heads are weak... possibly defective. When I attempt to tighten the heads, the heads often refuse to stay put. Weak, weak, weak product. Very dissatisfied with the heads, in particular, not the entire mount. These are supposed to support up to a 10 pound camera. Mine weigh less than three (3) pounds and the Videosecu heads seem very untrustworthy... even with only that little weight. The fact that the mount is metal is good. The fact that the mount features modular pieces that are all connected with standard 1/4"" threads is also good. But I had to buy stronger Manfrotto heads to replace the heads that came with my Videosecu mounts.",1
"Great watch, hard to remove links: I found this watch at a local department store where I waited quite a while for service. When the sales person walked away for a break - I did a check to see if Amazon carried the watch and THEY DID. Love the watch, love the complements that I get while wearing it. I have a rather small wrist that tends to be a challenge to find a watch for - most watches these days have larger faces that over power the size of my wrist. This one - perfect sized for the small wrist people. The only thing that made me not give it 5 stars is that it is a bit large for my wrist and removing the links is super difficult so I wear it more as a ""watch/bracelet"" than just a watch. With all of that said - if you are someone who has a smaller wrist that is overpowered by the current styles who is looking for a classic timepiece - this is the one for you.",2
"Rather a waste...: Looks like I'm alone, but I found this book frightfully superficial and entirely lacking in depth. The marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales, and for that matter, the relationships between the Prince and his mistresses, is glossed over and there is nothing in this book that makes one feel like they have learned anything substantial about anyone. I was SO disappointed, having read many other wonderful books on the subject. This is hardly worth the time or effort to order/read this one.",1
"Absolutely wonderful: This product helps you learn japanese faster than learning online. It helps you understand the grammar and phonetics of Japanese as well as the culture. It has a little bit of everything of japan. However, you may need a teacher to help you through the book.",2
"Bounty Hunter metal Detector: I wanted this detector to recover knives, trimming shears etc. that were accidently tossed over the mountainside with weeds. Happy with the recovery results. Found a good florists knife that I had lost seven years ago and buried about 4"" under dirt.Since I've had fun searching beaches and small streams(still looking for gold nuggets without success).It's light weight and easy to handle and has a loud enough beep when metal is located. It's a great item for the novice for the price!!!",2
"Horrible: Amazon messed up my order, then Falcon Farms fixed it, then Falcon Farms screwed it up again. It was supposed to be delivered on Valentines Day, but Falcon Farms made an error on the shipping label and therefore it was shipped back to Falcon Farms, here it is one day after valentines day and still flowerless. Horrible service, I will not order flowers from this store again.",1
"What the hell is this? A Johnny Cash-in..: While Johnny Cash is a complete legend, the epitome of ""white man blues"", this set is nothing more than a cash-in of his recent resurgence! The tracks in this set are remixed heaps of junk that, sound nothing like this original. Stay clear of this if you want pristine original records and not some junk. Cheers",1
"Moolicious? More like Moopulsive!: (Okay, this review is not for this exact product. But I purchased a Shonfeld's Moolicious Cocoa Mix tonight and I needed to warn the rest of the hot cocoa consumers out there.)Have you ever tasted hot frothy cardboard? Want to? Try Shonfeld's Moolicious Cocoa Mix! It is the moost disgusting imootation of hot chocolate I have ever tasted. I was really in the moood for cocoa and saw this adorable glass bottle of cocoa powder. I honestly couldn't stomach it. Had to pour it all out. Blech. Waste of time, waste of money. Do not be fooled! And don't buy any Shonfeld's gift packs. They are obviously making some seriously crappy products. Seriously Moopulsive...",1
stack o matic....malfunction o matic: will only occasionaly let the next record drop and if you do get 3 to play the next one slows down the turn table.,1
"Great Product: I bought this compact DVD player for my daughter who travels a lot with her basketball team and she really enjoys using it. The only complaint she has is that the battery only last an hour even after it has been fully charged. I am not sure if the battery runs out sooner if you switch back and forth from DVD to CD but it would be nice if the battery lasted longer. Even though the screen is small it shows one of the clearest pictures I have ever seen. The case is not big enough to carry all the accessories either, but all in all it is a great product.",2
"Auto sensor not work properly, it`s so Noise train: There are three problem of the product. Auto sensor does not work properly and there is no auto turn off function, it`s like Noise train, Who say it was quiet? I couldn`t sleep because of it`s noise even whisper(minimum speed) mode.Don`t waste your money and time to return it, and Just one filtered. but that`s a advantage to save money(you don`t need to buy filter again). if you want to buy chip air purifier, it`s one of your solution but if you want real purifier, it`s not good choice.",1
"This film reminded me of ""The Brown Bunny""...: Both movies are shot at a VERY relaxed pace, essentially a film-length series of random-seeming slices of one person's life. And the scenes come very close to mundane, yet they become quite captivating if the viewer is ready to slow down. ""Somewhere"" will likely be ignored by 99% of the movie-watching public who are so habituated now to face-paced movies of all genres. Once again, Sophia does her own thing and dares viewers to tag along. I suggest watching this when you are slightly sleepy or stoned!",2
"5.0 revision is not Windows 2000 comptible - next revisions are OK: Thought to be a great piece of soft ware, if you can use it. The software rendered Windows 2000 Operating system useless. Windows 200 failed to boot, even in SAFE MODE, after installing this so called Easy CD Creator 5 PLATINUM. Windows 2000 user BEWARE! You might be the next victim. Wonder what ROXIO going to say about this problem. Can they make up the lost time to reinstall the operating system and the applications? It's not so easy anymoreUpdate: I called Roxio Tech support, and they took note of the poblem. A few days later they sent me a notice that a patch was available for download. The patch fixed the problems. Roxio also sent me a free licensed copy of GoBack 3.0Then again I wrote this review back in 2001",1
"an unrealistic flick with bad acting: Aside from the Olsen twins, I thought the acting in this film was downright...well, it was bad. The movie was also unrealisitic. What parents let their twin daughters, their 2 friends, and 3 members of the opposite sex go to a ritzy ski lodge in Utah to watch, of all things, the Olympics? And what parents give their kid a fire engine red convertible for their birthday? And what kids just keep buying zillions of plane tickets, throwing away about 200 bucks per ticket? And who thought a movie about trying to get somewhere would be entertaining? The only reason this movie got 2 stars was because there were a few remotely funny parts, and the Olsen twins were what held the whole movie together. Them not ending up with boyfriends was pretty funny - their friends did though. Usually their movies are like they say hi to a boy and he falls instantly in luv. Although Kylie does have an admirer in this movie...",1
"Quality product at a good price: This is a quality mount. Good enough to support a 32 inch LCD in my bedroom. Use hex head bolts instead of the supplied screws, it will make installation a lot easier. A little more than other mounts but a lot stronger. I use my old mount for a ligher TV.",2
"Rubbish: I heard this gentleman do a presentation which was filled with a plethora of logical fallacies, sheer nonsense, and laughable logic. This book merely dumbs down dumb ideas to something a kindergartener would find ridiculous. Evolution does not preclude a belief in God, and ""Dr."" McMurtry (if you research, he received his ""Doctorate of Divinity""--usually an honorary degree--from an unaccredited Bible College) seems to want everyone to believe that you are either a Bible-fearing believer or an atheist. A typical either/or fallacy and pure rubbish. Don't waste your time with this pseudo-scientific hack.",1
"Nice Flavor: Very nice flavor. The ingredients all contribute to good health. Tried the pure pomegranate, and the taste is a bit harsh. Would be better if Lakewood clarified what percentage of the juice is pomegranate. The 100% pomegranate is approximately double the price. Perhaps this blend contains less than 50% pomegranate juice, without the vendor specifying, one is left to guess.",2
"Does the job: We've had this humidifier for 5 years anyway, andThese filters work great lasting a long Time. Price is right too",2
"Excellent Picture: I just set up my new home theater system. I have this 27A41 TV with a Toshiba 2150 dvd player using the Colorstream component cables. The picture on dvd is incredible, especially for a $... tv. I was impressed not only with the detail and resolution, but the richness of the color as well. The only bad thing about the TV is that the speakers are not that great. When I watched the first dvd on my new setup, the picture was so awesome, but the sound was not that great, so I decided to get a home theater in a box system, so the sound is not a problem anymore. The tv is definitely a great option if you want a sweet system while keeping the total cost of your home theater under $....",2
"Not for those with sensitive skin: I can stand a ""little pain"", so after reading the reviews here I decided to buy the Tweeze Tweezer. I gave it a try and ended up throwing it away. It is not just a little pain; in some places (upper lip area) it is very painful and not worth it IMO. I have sensitive skin which could be the problem and when I used it around my chin, my skin was not happy - it looked like I had welts in some areas and my skin was very red and swollen. I followed the directions of using it at a 90 degree angle, but it is just too much for my skin I guess. It was so cheap that I thought it was worth a try. For those with tougher skin that can take the pain, it may work just fine.",1
"Holds the readers attention to the very end!: Angels on my Wings is a well-written story that will leave you in a cold sweat. A commercial airliner suffers a high-altitude decompression, leaving flight controls damaged. A fatal crash seems imminent, placing everyone on board in a life-threatening situation.You feel as though you are actually in the airplane, experiencing what the book's characters are going through. The author builds the tension, page by page, and so holding the reader's attention to the very end.Will the plane crash or land safely? You must read this exciting book to find out the answer.Review by award-winning authr, Bobby Ruble, author of Have No Mercy and co-author with wife, Kam, of Black Rosebud: Have No Mercy II.",2
"One of the best contemporary authors out there!: This book really impressed me. Two writing degrees and endless workshops and book discussions,left me wondering if there were any fresh perspectives out there. Egan is one! This book deals with identity on multiple layers, revealing the disguises and lies surrounding life. Buy it and read it today!!",2
"Memory Almost Full: My memory is full of the best of Paul McCartney.This has to be the worst thing I have ever heard from Sir Paul.The Beatles, Wings.....how do you release something like this.This man was part of the best thing that ever happened to music. I have loved the Beatles and Sir Paul for my entire life....but the truth be told. This stinks.",1
"NO STAR!!!!: This guy is worst than 50 cents himself. These ""tribute"" albums are a joke. Avoid at all cost!!!",1
"James Bond is still worth it: This is the first time I made myself watch a Bond movie with Pierce Brosnan - 'cause usually I don't like him, he is not macho enough to play that role. But I was surprised. Even tough he does look too old and unattractive and lacks charm, he does play pretty alright.The story itself is the usual Bond stuff, and even though you know 007 is gonna get through, the makers of The World Is Not Enough have managed to throw in some really exciting scenes.James Bond movies still seems the only successfull way to combine action, humour and beautiful chicks!",2
"Scary Story Blunder: The stories are classic and fine for kids- except the titles gives the surprise away every time... if you're reading it to them you can just skip the title- or try to if you're reading it for yourself- but the publishing company, if not the author really should have realized how the title ruins it!",1
"Eric: I love this book! It is the true story of a very courageous young man, Eric Lund, who defied the verdict of his prognosis, living 2-1/2 years longer than his doctor had said he would! He was a determined athlete who refused to let his disease (ALL: Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia) get him down!",2
"Works perfectly, easy to install: I have about 6 of these now installed in my office. It takes just a few minutes to find a stud and drill the necessary holes. No complaints.",2
"A Great Supplement to 'Slip': If you liked their full release 'Slip', you will like this album. The sound quality is not as good as 'Slip', but this album was released a few years before it. 4 1/2 stars.",2
"Another great film from Cage.: I love Nicolas Cage.He is such a good actor, because unlike actors such as Sylvestor Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger who put out in invincible sort of act, he puts out the innocent guy who really has a life and can be killed act, and it works great.Thismovie is basically about a boxing matchl;there is a shooting during a big fight, and as the story line unravels you discover all kinds of conspiracies amdn mysteries.This movie keeps your attention, i loved it.",2
"worse than Southern Hip Hop: This smells like grabage to me. I took this CD out from my local library. ""White Girl"" is a shameless rip-off of the classic NY Hip Hop gem ""Fly Girl"" by the Boogie Boys in 1985. All his ""slan'guage"" is just downright wack; no wonder he only sells in his home-town.",1
"assembly required??????: We thought this would be the big hit christmas morning, wrong. Had a hard time assembling product. Would be nice if required screws were provided. While our daughter typically loves doll play this one was in the closet within the day. Win some lose some.",1
Can't Beat Makita Quality: I bought this for a 15-year-old drill/driver. This battery replaced the 14.4VDC NiCads that lasted nearly a decade and a half. This battery has rejuvenated my used and abused Makita to better than new condition. I look forward to another 15 years of tough-torquing Makita power.,2
"Sputter, sputter: The story setup was great ... quarantined town, neighboring towns in trouble, fort nearby, Philip's moral dilemma. All the pieces were set, and then ... the author just didn't know what to do with the great setup he'd created. The last 50 pages were an extreme letdown. I can just imagine someone like Stephen King taking the story's setup and running with it ...",1
Just good clean reading.: I love reading Annie Jones. Her books are good inspirational reading. Set in the South was also a draw for me. The characters are real who are not perfect but who strive to be. I recommend any of Annie Jones' books if you want an exciting read without being vulgar or violent.,2
"Informative but not as practical: It has a large section on how infant potty training is used all over the world, but it doesn't have as much PRACTICAL information as I need -- like the various sign babies use, how to really get started. It's very brief on info like that.",1
"Yummy!: I was fortunate enough to receive this wonderful cookbook as a gift...I have enjoyed making a number of the incredible recipes ~ particularly the salmon fillets in puff pastry and the Boston salad with pears, blue cheese and walnuts. What perfect items for a dinner party ~ easy and a beautiful presentation. My guests think I've been slaving in the kitchen for days! Thanks to my dear Vermont friend for sharing this little gem with me!",2
"An excellent book for TBI relatives and friends: It is a disappointment that people, especially kids, are not told she wasn't wearing a helmet while riding her bike. I never fail to tell kids that if I hadn't had my own, not-a-beatup-loaner, approved motorcycle helmet on when I crashed a hang glider, I would have died for sure as I came back from a coma etc. to a good life. Just a little more damage from a poor helmet would have killed me, or turned me into a life support cabbage.the book is very good otherwise, and I recommend it to anyone trying to understand how someone with TBI can do some things fine, but not others.Best description of TBI I have made up, which could be applied to hers; Your brain is a map on the wall. Close your eyes, reach behind you and grab an unknown number of darts. Throw them blindly at the map. Some areas get hit, some don't, some totalled. It's not an IQ thing.",2
"Tastes like fireballs Candy: If you like artificial fireballs candy, then you will like this tea. Personally I hate fireballs, so this tea was a huge disappointment. My son didn't like it either.",1
"Crab Shells: These would be good if you had a really small Hermit Crab,But for my Hermit Crab they were way to small. Would not recommend for a normal size Hermit Crab.",1
Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr: Don't Watch. Would elaborate but couldn't live with myself if I wasted any more time of my life in regards to this movie. Just trying to save others.,1
"Diappointed: The toy seems really great but my son has shown no interest in it whatsoever. He has it out over a month now and he hasn't gravitated towards it yet. He puts everything in his mouth, so i thought that maybe just to chew on it he would do that.I guess he just doesn't like the thing.",1
"Yes, this is music.: Many stateside listeners know The Verve only from the song ""Bittersweet Symphony,"" or perhaps the album Urban Hymns. For these listeners, there is a wealth of great music to be found on this greatest hits album. Songs such as ""This is Music"" and ""History"" are easily on par with the better known tracks from Urban Hymns, such as the gems ""The Drugs Don't Work"" and ""Lucky Man."" Fans will surely have favorite songs that didn't meet the ""singles"" requirement for inclusion on this album. For me, ""So Sister"" would have completed this 5 Star effort. However, it's pretty safe to say that this is the best of The Verve, and therefore some of the best music around. If you already own all of these tracks then you might be dissapointed with this package--there are two new tracks, but no live or rare material (thus, the label ""Singles""). Still worth the price of admission for Verve fans.",2
"Works as advertised: Though I don't use it any longer since I just gave in and bought a new monitor, for those not trying to spend $100 more since you bought a new video card without a VGA port, this is a good alternative until you can get the money needed to complete your upgrade.",2
Great Book For Moms: I Love this book as does my 5 year old daughter. We decided to get 2 more of this book to give to or moms & grandmas for mother's day! It's got a great message.,2
"Disappointed: I usually pride myself on being able to understand and appreciate movies with dark, complex or subtle themes. True, the acting is good in Swimming Pool, but I failed to enjoy this DVD at any other level. Note: If the beginning 7 minute inability to access a menu or skip ahead becomes a trend I hope consumers will be very vocal in their outrage.",1
"Quantity, ... not Quality: The author does a good job of listing almost every hike available. I thoroughly enjoyed the story behind the writing of this book, but I found the hike descriptions too brief to be of any use. In the end i relied on a National Geographic/Trails Illustrated topo maps of ""Rocky Mountains"" and ""Indian Peaks"" purchased at a local hiking store, and Jerome Malitz's (Rock Mountain Park Day hikers guide). I ended up using this book as reading material after hiking all day, and as reference material to plan hikes for the upcoming day.",1
Orchids of North America: The book serves as good checklist for the North American species. It should not be construed as anything more than that. The photos are subpar.,1
"Measuring america: This is an interesting book about how America was surveyed. It describes the hard work of accuratly surveying a contenent, and also the frauds and shoddy work as well; and the problems created by bad survey jobs. You learn why streets are as wide as they are and why blocks are sized as they are, all based upon the survor's chain. It is a good read if you are technically inclined.",2
"Not bad: I've had my share of good and bad workout gloves and these score better than most. Leather and mesh are of a really nice quality and very soft, yet durable. Two gripes though: one, the cut is a bit odd, with no velcro strap and with this pointy thing instead, which (for me, at least) hits right at the bump of my wrist bone -- can be irritating. Two, the seams on the palm are a bit thick and rough, to the point of giving me blisters on my left hand. Other than that, though, the slip-on thing can actually be a plus as they're much easier to put on and take off than regular designs.",2
"HE ROBOT?: There are times in this generally well-made film that you wish director Gary Fleder hadn't let the action sag in the middle. Although it didn't destroy the film, it keeps it from being a true scifi classic.Gary Sinise stars as a scientist who is determined to be a cyborg created to blow up a visiting chancellor. Vincent D'Onofrio is the diehard military man out to destroy him. Madeleine Stowe is Sinise's physician wife who wants to stand by her man regardless. Tony Shalhoub has a very brief role as Sinise's best friend, and Mekhi Pifer is an underground rebel who helps Sinise out.The visual effects are stunning and beautifully filmed. The performances on the whole are adequate; D'Onofrio is brilliant, as always. The ending has a twist that I didn't see coming, but one that makes good sense.IMPOSTOR is not a classic, but it is a well directed and acted adventure yarn.",2
"A fansinated reader from ""crazy in Alabama"": I had to read this book for an assignment in my lit class.And at first I thought it was some stupid war book. But actually Im glad now that I did read it because it was so good. It was kind of like Anne Frank's life but a little better.",2
"Incredible that I'd never heard of this movie before...: I can't get over how good this movie is. I won't take up a bunch of bytes restating what everyone else here has already said (probably better than I would), I'll just rate it what it's worth and be done. But still, I just can't get over the fact that I'd never heard a peep about it before! I'm too young to use the word, but I have to admit that I'm a bit flabbergasted...",2
"Think Tank: They may have lost their lead guitarist but they haven't lost soul. Blur's latest LP, Think Tank refreshes old tricks and brings new hooks to create a great Brit-Pop album. The tracks range from mellow melodical tunes like ""Out of Time"" to white knuckle rock riffed tracks like ""Crazy Beat"" to beat ridden, effects laiden songs like ""On My Way To The Club."" It's obvious that singer Damon Albarn quite enjoyed his work on his side project ""The Gorillaz."" It shows on Think Tank. It spans from rock to pop to hip hop to eastern style Arabic-like music. With the absence of their lead guitarist they make-up for it with driving bass-lines (like in the nearly instrumental pounding ""Jets"") and bizzare sound effects (like in the Song 2ish ""Crazy Beat""). Blur is back and ready to rock the house, or club, or whatever. 8/10 Highlights: ""Crazy Beat"" ""Out of Time"" ""On My Way To The Club"" ""Battery in Your Leg"" ""Jets""",2
"Interesting premise: Too bad the author could not live up to his plot outline. I read with interest the review written by a 'reader from Florida' that proposes readers that do not like this book are gay, anti-gun liberals. I am none of those things, in fact, I cannot wait until deer season each year in this part of the country, and I have read nearly anything 'good' that falls into this genre; i.e. any Tom Clancy novel, any Stephen Hunter novel (the 'Bob the Nailer' series in particular), but I can find nothing in this authors vision that would prompt me to pick up another of his books. The action is simplistic, the reparte is juvenile, the set-ups are transparent, and the justification for the use of violence seem to be an NRA-sanctioned advertisement. I can only hope that the writer will not find a big audience for this type of book.",1
"Very good deal!: This PC has been great,looks new,and is a very capable PC.It is more than worth the amount paid for it.I couldn't believe what I got for the money spent.It was ready to go out of the box.No complaints,was setup correctly and will handle all I need it for!You really can't go wrong purchasing one from this company!!!Oh yeah,they included a mouse with it,which I wasn't expecting!",2
"a different outlook on the book: In my work, I have had to help several mothers who have tried the ""babywise"" system and their babies have not done well on it.There is a big difference between survive and thrive. If your baby survived this book, you are one of the few lucky ones. Fact is there are many who don't do so well on it.Just chew on this, are you able to go many hours w/o so much as a sip of water, or a tiny bit of food? Thats what this book tells you to do to your baby, only your baby can't tell time. There is nothing sadder than seeing a baby who is obviously hungry, showing his mother all the signs and crying but the mother is telling her child ""but its not TIME for you to eat yet. The book says you have to wait"". (Incidently, the baby I just mentioned has many health problems now that could have been easily prevented)Whatever your parenting decisions, make them with love for your child, not for the sake of convience for you. Everyone will be happier for it.",1

"WOW!: The moment that you hear ""Phantom""- you'll be hooked! It is literally addictive! I love it! Phantom of The Opera is just incredible!! It has beautiful songs like ""The Phantom of the Opera"", ""Think of Me"", and my favorite: ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" . The melodies are beautiful, and the story is heart-wrenching! Michael Crawford has the most amazing voice- if it is possible to fall in love with a voice- I did. I can never picture anyone in the role of the Phantom but him. Sarah Brightman has the most beautiful voice- and it's incredible how high she can get! It is overall one of my favorite musicals, if not my very favorite.",2
"No reason to buy this lens: There's absolutely no reason to buy this lens when you can instead get the Canon EF 28-105 f/3.5-4.5. It's a faster lens with signiicantly better image and build quality, and is only about $50 more than this cheap plastic/slower version.",1
"So bad I sullied my breeches: I was appalled! Not only is the subject matter nauseating, but the writing is not up to snuff. The characters all lack depth and 'elan', and the plot moves very, very slowly.In my country we prefer not to speak of such matters, and when we do, we have the literary resources to clean up afterwards.",1

"I think this is my last Lucas/Spielberg film... ever.: Yes, it's a very bold statement to never want to see a Lucas or Spielberg film again. But all of the negative commentary you've heard about the movie was true. Miracle refrigerators that save Indy from nuclear testing, Lebeauf swinging in the trees with the monkeys, crystal skulls that look like they were purchased from a local costume shop, and of course... ALIENS. And let's not forget that all the ""special"" effects look like nothing more than CGI on a soundstage. At the very least, the first three are classic, epic films. If you love the first three, please don't see this film.",1
"You just have to read this book!: I read this book my junior year in high school. Now I choose it as my topic in my analytical paper. This book is amazing! Its plot could relate to any audience. You become totally enthralled, this same senario could happen to us! I have suggested this reading to several friends and they all loved it. Now I have to buy my own copy again. This will be my second time reading this novel. I have NEVER read a book twice. You have to read this masterpiece to really understand how absolutely wonderful it is!",2
"Great for the PC: Purchased to replace an old mic. I Dislike very much all the microphones on headsets, nor do I like to wear one 100% of the time I am gaming or chatting with friends. This mic is attached to my keyboard cable and picks me up loud and clear, all those who hear me ask what mic I am using. They say it sounds like im in their room.Only con (and not the fault of the product) is that the cord is very short to route from my desk to the back of my PC. However I am using this mic for an unintended purpose, just be aware its a 36"" cable or so.Also make sure your Mic attach point on your motherboard delivers good amounts of power, older PCs might not have this.",2
"Fun introduction to Mind Mapping: I love this book. It's very straight forward and makes for a really quick read. Theory and discussion are written on the left pages, while the right side contains full size, wonderfully hand drawn, mind maps featuring some topic or style or technique that is discussed next to it. The book is broken down contextually by chapters. First it teaches readers the basics, then it gets into a few good uses for maps, followed by teaching you how to build a personal symbology. The rest of the book discusses techniques and uses for mapping in educational environments, an adult's personal life and professional businesses. It also includes an extensive bibliography and resource listing.",2

"Do NOT Buy! This Product is DANGEROUS!!: The Power 2000 line of chargers have been woefully awful in my experience. My first one worked for a while, then suddenly the batteries would not hold a charge. This was already a bad sign, since NiMH batteris are supposed to be long-life. Because I liked its compact size for travel, I decided to give this charger one more try. I purchased a current model, the Power 2000 XP-333.Several hours after inserting the batteries properly and plugging the unit in, I noticed a burning electrical smell. When I traced the odor back to the new charger, I of course unplugged it and nearly burnt myself on the batteries, which were scorchingly hot. I fear they might have burst or started a fire had I left them in the charger any longer.There are too many other dependable charger makers -- why take a chance on this unreliable, dangerous product? This product should be rated zero stars -- it's earned a skull & crossbones warning in my opinion!",1
"Boring missions, ugly graphics: I was hoping for an interesting simulation of ""real life"" in this game, with its world open to be explored. But I found the graphics poor (I have free games that look better), and the missions were really boring, like looking for and erasing some 20 graffitis all over one area of town.",1
"the amazingly cute webkinz bear!: The webkinz bear is one of the cutest webkinz of them all. This toy, to my surprise, is not very popular. But that is the cool thing about it. When you go online, you don't see that many of them. I have shown my friends this bear and they all want it, and agree that it is just adorable. It's a little different than some of the other webkinz, but that makes it a unique cutey. It keeps in really good shape, and is really very interesting. I think any age could enjoy it. My 5 year old cousin is simply in love with it. I also think that any boy would like it as well. My 8 year old cousin (who is a boy) loves it and wants one, too. I think the bear will get popular once people realize how wonderful it is. Get the webkinz bear: whoever you give it to will love it for sure!",2

"Ice that will warm any Bjork Fan: Ice is a tribute album unlike any other. This is a collection of some of Bjork's most moving and dramatic pieces presented in a innovative and beautiful way that makes you truly appreciate Bjork's unique vision of music.This a purely an instrument album but the use of strings in place of vocals is so well done you barely notice the difference.My personal favorites are ""Venus as a boy"" and ""Bacholorette""If you a fan of Bjork give this CD a listen you may be plesantly surprised.",2

"Very disappointed with this monitor: We purchased this monitor so that we would be able to watch our baby at night. When we hooked it up, we noticed that the top third of the monitor screen was messed up (fuzzy, distorted lines). So we exchanged it for the same monitor. The new monitor does not have the distorted lines, but it will not work in our bedroom. After hours of trying to adjust it and reposition it, we were still unable to use it in our bedroom, which of course defeats the entire purpose of having it. Unfortantely, we are going to return it and look for a better monitor.",1

"Fifth Horseman Doesn't Disappoint: A year-and-a-half ago, I was privileged to read the manuscript of The Fifth Horseman and do some minor editing on it. I was completely engrossed. It is a page-turning, sleep-depriving techno-thriller that is better than virtually anything on the market. Richard Sherbaniuk has created compelling, interesting characters embroiled in a seemingly insoluble eco-disaster of world-wide proportions. The book grabs you on page one and you are virtually compelled to hang on with both hands until the end.I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Yes, Richard Sherbaniuk is a friend of mine - we belong to the same professional writers organization - but we have never met and have done all our transacting online. I hope I'm not biased in favor of Richard. I'm merely biased in favor of the great book he has produced.Now, if he would just send me the manuscript for his next book...",2
"Scooby Boo!!!: TThis was a bad adaption of the cartoon movie serials. It was much scarier. If you rent it, enjoy the extras but don't watch the unbearably bad film.",1
"Read this, alright?: This book is appealing no matter how old you are. On one level it's a character story, about a wrongly condemmed boy named Stanley Yelnats and his experience at Camp Green Lake. (A dry, waterless nothing.)But the other (and best) part is the sub-plots. There is indeed a mystery aspect to the story, and it's brought to light by making jumps into the past. So at times, it tells two stories and they come brilliantly together in the end. If you don't get what I mean, well it's hard to explain! Read the book and find out the secrets.Bottom Line?: A MUST READ!!!",2
"Okay start.: The movie kicks off with a postive start, but as time goes on seems to drag on. I fount myself sitting there wishing the movie would end. It has a ensemble cast, and they all do a great job but even that doesn't save the movie. The singing scenes are fun at first, but as the time goes on like the movie they all start to drag on.",1
"brad dourif! why?: Thirty minutes into this disaster I knew this was gonna suck. Brad Dourif's acting is just as intense as any other horror based role he has done but his dialogue was horrid. I felt embarrassed for Brad in this movie. As for the kid in the trenchcoat, his acting was laughably bad. Save your money and pick it up at the pawn shop which is where i am taking my copy to. As for the special effects , they were as atrocious as the acting. Special indeed.",1

"Good but a touch repetitive: I really enjoyed reading this book. It was very insightful especially being a black guy recently settled in the US. The US racial politics is so complicated due to its history and this book goes some way to explaining some of the issues involved. My one minor complaint is that it was a touch repetitive, which is somewhat understandable because it is a collection of essays as stated in the introduction. Nevertheless, it did sometimes get irritating. Recommended reading however",2
Movie was great as I remember but: Amazon Streaming Video kept dying and having to be restarted. Everytime I checked the connection and it was always up with 20+M of download speed.

I'm just not sure what the agenda was for Wild Light. There isn't one track on the album that could justify my holding onto this CD. I had to sell it to a used Record shop. KEEP AWAY FANS OF ELECTRO! This album is NOT enjoyable.If you are looking to discover great Electro albums, look into Ladytrons Light and Magic, Fischerspooners Odyssey, Felix da Housecat's Devin Dazzle and the Neon Fever, Adult's Resuscitation, Goldenboy's OR, Mount Sims' Ultra Sex, or even Goldfrapps sophomore release Black Cherry has a somewhat Electro feel.",1

Beautiful styling and the absolute greatest PQ currently available is destroyed by the most annoying defect next to a stuck pixel, MURA.

The only good parts are the parts about the Academic Bowl. It's really boring. I am only reading it because I have to. I wonder how this ever won any prize.

"Superb Documentary, Lousy DVD Pressing: The film is a superb investigation into the history of American empire. That is, as much of it as the irregular stuttering of the playback on this poorly-pressed DVD would allow me to watch before I gave up in frustration.Sony did a botch job of the production of this film on DVD.Because of Amazon's policy prohibiting the return of opened DVDs, I would recommend against buying this DVD new from Amazon. There are several well-recommended vendors listed on Amazon that guarantee the used DVD you purchase from them will be playable, or you can return it for an exchange, or for your money back. If you can't see this fine film in its theatrical release, buying it used from one of those vendors would be your next best bet. At least then, if you get a defective DVD like I did, you would have some recourse.",1

"Poor Handles/Poor Service: Had this case for less than 1 yr and the handles inside the neoprene covering ripped apart. Called Marware, they wouldn't stand behind their product. So my wife took the handles apart, the nylon webbing that is used is pitiful-no wonder it tore. She replaced it with heavier nylon and handstitched everything back. Now it is sturdy enough to handle the weight of the 17"" for a long time. The rest of the case is good otherwise. But guaranteed that the handle material inside will not stand up - when that happens, expect your neoprene handles to stretch double in length.",1
"a real work: Reading the reviews about the book you might come across some cheap and detestable judgments like the one Dr. Chavchavadze has written. Anybody who has some degree of knowledge about Abkhazia knows that such judgements represent the official Georgian stance, which all of the Georgian governments have pursued for decades. I am sure that the current Georgian government has paid these puppets enough so that the truth about the decades-old Georgian chauvinism could be prevented from being known by the international community. It is quite amazing to see that they have gone as far as requesting the University of London to dismiss Mr. Hewitt or asking St. Martin's Press to stop the sale of the book. You can ban books but you cannot ban the truth. Brains' path is one and it is sad that they cannot see this.I salute George Hewitt with great respect and appreciation for his extensive contribution to the Abkhazian resistance against despotism.",2

"Shame on you CBS and Dan Rather: I purchased this book hoping to keep the DVD as a historical record for my children of the events of 9/11. To my shock and horror, I realized that as the day played out on the DVD and they reached 6 pm...then 8 pm....that they had made no mention whatsoever of Flight 93, which crashed in Pennsylvania. I felt sick to think of how this dishonored the memory of those victims, not to mention the insult to their families. Did CBS not feel this tragedy even warranted mentioning? Does the loss of lives in a field mean less than at the base of a skyscraper? The DVD went on in numerous interviews, etc. in the weeks that followed 9/11. Finally, more than an hour into the DVD, the first mention of Flight 93 came, but it was brief and came off as an afterthought, then footage of the WTC resumed. I was sickened at the insensitivity and felt the DVD to be not very historically accurate as it was so selective in presuming what really mattered.",1

"Useless and why can't I give zero stars?: I ordered this book with the thought I might be able to make a few of their projects. Not. They specify yarn types by brand, and those brands are not available in my country. Yes, they give a gauge, but what am I supposed to do? Buy every yarn available and hope one might conform? This book is only advertising for the yarn brand and of no help to someone who only wants to knit their dog a sweater. I will probably burn the book when the weather is cool enough for my guys to need a sweater.........",1

This was a boy who was laughed at when he was a kid, who considered himself 'weird,' and who got into enough trouble to get kicked out the house a few times. But God's hand was upon this musically gifted man, and the rest is history. You may laugh, cry, and rejoice as you read about the trying experiences of one of this decade's most observed and celebrated gospel artists.",2
"Uh....that's it?: Excuse me, but can someone tell me what happened here? The movie starts off okay but then it starts rolling down the relentless hill of, ""what the heck is this?"" I'm not a fan of gorey horror movies, but come on! This has absolutely nothing scary in it! They hear some cracking branches, find some piles of rocks, and some stick figure things in the trees that look like ceiling fans. Ooooh. Scary. I bet you that's where they got the idea for the Blair Witch symbol...somebody looked up at a ceiling fan and said, ""Hey. This could actually work. I mean, most people are stupid enough to buy into it."" As Chris Rock stated during the MTV Movie Awards, I'd also like to know where the people are with the other 30,000 dollars that it so called ""took to make this movie."" Hardly. Any moron with a camera could tromp into some ""scary"" woods and start filming like blithering idiots. Do the world a favor and burn this movie if you own it and if not, never ever see it.",1
"Amazingly Great Value: We started using it the moment it arrived. It's easy to set-up, easy to use. The suction device that holds it to the windshield works really well. It's suggested routes to locations in nearby cities are better than the more common routes I have used in the past. I've been using it in rural northern Michigan and it knows every road up here!

"A tale of one man's fight to combat American degeneracy.: This is an inspiring novel concerning a man who can no longer sit still while the forces of evil and filth envelop his beloved and once-great nation. He has the strength of character that forces him to exert his will and take a stand against those he rightly perceives as the enemies of his civilization, his race, his nation and his own self. It is a story of Holy War. Patriotic and spiritually healthy men and women will find themselves cheering the exploits of the protagonist",2
"Weak and derivative: Having been a longtime fan of most of Connelly's work, it is with some sadness to report that this novel does not add to his often stellar oeuvre. The Poet, an earlier serial killer marked by his menacing ingenuity, returns as a cut-out villain lacking smarts and a great degree of threat in this tired thriller. In what amounts to a reunion of sorts for prior Connelly characters, Harry Bosch seems too human and well-drawn to be occupying this world of caricatures and plot cliches. Connelly namechecks two other crime authors, George Pelecanos and Ian Rankin, who are both writing at a superior level at present. Check them out instead.",1
"waste of time: Weak, with no information on the page to help you make a decision on the contents. Page should have additional information.",1
"Great alternative to RTS: I'm sick to death of Company of Heroes and Command & Conquer type games, where I can't even process a full thought before having to fling units all over a map in panicked desperation, so this game (and series) is exactly what I've been craving. This game is quite ugly compared to the modern RTS darlings, but you can actually plot and contemplate your moves, which is a benefit that fully overtakes any complaints about graphics. There's a whole slew of scenarios included, and a .zip file on the Battlefront website will give you hundreds more (including some nice non-historical change-ups, like the Axis forces invading a Catholic school in Ottawa).",2
Best inexpensive router on the market: I have helped set up4 of these. I have also setup d-Link and Netgear routers. This is by far the easiest router to setup and configure. If you use the Internet to play games against your friends then this is the router you want.,2
"what is wrong with her?: After reading several pages, I feel disgusted. She is exactly like the Hard core leftest in China. She would kill all the students in the Square if she is a chinese. And she would call everybody with a PhD a treason. What has she done for her country while she calls others treasons? She is talking nonsense.",1
"Still a gem! I think. Part I of Review: I received the book today and decided that I would go through the reviews again. I was always taught that if you read the Preface of a book, you get a general idea of the book's purpose. Obviously, your reviewers giving low ratings, never read the preface or introduction to the book. This is especially directed to those who are professionals. Listen to what the 14 year-old wrote. Perhaps this textbook is not intended for students requiring a lot of tutoring, or individuals not wanting a scholarly approach to musical theory. I will finish reading the book and follow-up with Part II of this review. At this time, it is still the bible of musical theory -- bar none! It is a scholarly and historical approach to the history of music theory. Please keep this in mind before writing a bad review.",2
Energizer Er-P507 Replaces Panasonic Hhr-P103: Replacement battery seems to work great. As good or better than origFit is good. I will buy another as a spare.,2
"PERFECT~~!!: This story was the best contemporary story I have read for Judith McNaught! I finished reading Perfect in one night and i loved it!!!!She is such an amazing author who knows how to make the characters look real, that for a moment you start thinking that there is actually a real actor/director called Zachary Benedict! I personally loved Zack and thought he had a great personality, and great strength to endure everything he's been through! It was also REALLY REALLY ROMANTIC and sweet the way he treated Julie. It is such an amazing story, and it is the PERFECT sequel for Paradise, which i also loved! I recommend this story to all of those who are fans of Judith McNaught and havent read it yet, and to those who have never read for her should start reading for her immediately!",2
"Fun for the truck lover: My son loves all his Chuck the Truck toys and we saw this movie at Wally World but for a lot more than they are selling it on Amazon. I did not realize this show is on HUB (a station I know not everyone gets), which we have but I don't like all the commercials. My kids love this DVD it has a catchy theme song that will get stuck in your head. If you have little ones who are fans of Chuck or the Cars movies this is one to check out.",2
"Good quality: not so big not so smallPerfect size I would say, goes well with dark clothes of coursethe Material is pretty good, it if gets dark then just polish it a little bit and that will be all",2
"the truth hurts: Reading the online reviews of this book were even more amusing than the book itself is! The reviews are perfect examples of the type of morons who believe urban legends. This book is a good read, but it forgets to mention that there is no Santa Claus. I would write more words, but a cow is stuck in a tree down the street, and I need to go help the poor thing get down.",2
"Keep Looking: This is the second Star Trek book that I've read by this author and, to say the least, I am disappointed. All of the nitpicks previously mentioned are all true (and very annoying to a true Trekkie- especially calling the Doctor ""Zimmerman""). Besides that, though, the story was just kind of boring and highly techincal in places. I ended up skimming quite a few paragraphs just because of the technical jargon used. I can understand a sentence or two, but not 2 paragraphs!!!!!!!!! All in all, not worth the time it takes to read it. (Check out Christie Golden's Star Trek books for some good reading)",1
"What a disapointment!: When I ran across this book in a store one day, I quickly bought it. What a disappointment. Mr. Woodbury's photographs are excellent, and can be seen in a number of field guides, but the information accompanying this book is useless. For example, Mr. Woodbury lists the Regal Fritillary, shows a photo, and gives a range description without once mentioning that this butterfly has not been recorded from the eastern United States for many years, outside a few local populations. One is left with the impression that this is a butterfly that may be seen commonly. It appears that the text of this book was quickly thrown together to get it into print. Recommended for the photos only",1
"Low quality: Considering that high quality flags only cost twice as much, the ""World Cup"" flags are a waste of money. The only things good about the flags are the case and the light weight. These flags look better in the picture than in reality. They nylon material used is also thicker and less flexible than the ones used in higher-quality flags. I regret purchasing this product.",1
"Not Quite Right: I bought this for my 11 month old son, who is about 30lbs. The neck was too big so food goes inside the bib and the arms were too short, so in general not a great buy for me.",1
"Don't buy this book: I disliked this book enough to get out of bed to come write this review to prevent others the agony of the knowledge that they paid good money to own this P.O.S. Horrible writing, no character development, virtually no plot. I have always hated Sex & the City so I don't know why I expected more for my $9 and change from Target. Candace Bushnell and the women characters she creates are self-loathing, neurotic witches. I hope she dies drunk and alone in a flophouse.",1
"Wonderful, but sad: As sad as it is to any Believer, this was a wonderful movie. I saw it in the theater and pre-ordered it here just so I would have it for all time. The producers really delved into the minds and lives of Red Sox fans, showing the joy, hope and devastation that we all feel.",2
"It's good to see there was a happy ending.: Angela's Ashes brought readers right into the lives of the McCourt boys. I loved the book and couldn't put it down; but at the end I did feel like I was left hanging. It was wonderful to read the continuing story of Frank, his brothers and his mom. As an Irish American who grew up in New York City, I always love reading about the two things closest to my heart - the Irish people and New York City. And I'm glad to know the McCourts of Limerick came out on top.",2
"Da Bomb!!!: I have been reading Animorphs since they came out. Out of all the books I think this is the best. When Prince Elfangor gives Tobias, Marco, Cassie, Jake and Rachel the power to morph he gives them one warning. Never Stay in a Morph for more than 2 hours. When the first try to attack the Yeerk Pool, Tobias is traped in a red-tailed hawk morph. Can Tobias firght the instincts of the hawk, or does he have to give in to survive?",2

"Not hip hop; not a party: I downloaded this video hoping for a workout; it wasn't close to aerobic (I'm in decent, but not phenomenal, shape). It also wasn't instructive (I would've settled for learning some hip moves) or interesting to watch/ listen to (WORST case, I expect some good music and inspiring dancers...but no). C-.",1
"first vol only: i think the first chapter is a b---- to get through, but after i did that i found the entire book either particularly useful or insightful. volume two never motivated it's own purchase.I read it in frech, so i cant talk about how well things are explained in english, just in case anything was lost in translation, but with something like chapter two on grassman variables i dont think it's such a big deal. to put it succintly chapter 2 makes berezin's book obsolete to me and i feel that way about the whole book.",2
"Apollo 16: Journey to Descartes: Problems with playback, as indicated in some reviews. Disk one will not playback the launch and disk 6 will not playback the splashdown. These were tested on several different players. My set was purchased brand new and factory sealed, the disk surfaces are perfect. Fortunately most of the moonwalks play. Some disks freeze and stop prior to the end of the recordings. I'm not sure just how much of the moonwalks are unwatchable. This would be a 5-star review, if not for the manufacturing defects. I would recommend contacting Spacecraft Films to get reassurance that these defects will be corrected with the new pressing due out in fall of 2010.",1
"Benecol Chews: 5 Benecol chews are required to lower cholesterol. I thought that at one time before the chews were discontinued, only 2 were required. 5 chews have too much sugar, but I suppose that I will continue to use them for awhile. I am trying to combine the chews with Benecol margarine so that I can take both fewer chews and less margarine.",1
"I love Melissa & Doug toys, but this is a big disappointment: I ditto the majority of the reviews of this toy. Although I really like most of the Melissa & Doug toys, I cannot figure out how this one is still on the market...Again, the fact that the lid will not stay on makes the toy nearly useless. The child cannot turn the cube in any direction to find the proper hole for the shape,and if she does, the top falls off or the block falls out. What is the point? It becomes just another box to keep blocks in.My 21 month old daughter simply takes the blocks and dumps them in other containers, it is completely useless as a shape sorter...I have to say it was a big waste of money, unlike the other toys by this manufacturer.",1
Very informative artbook..: I have been enjoying this book alot. it gives me quite abit of refs and it helps me out when I have projects due and I am stuck on a pose or having anatomy issues and need to freshen up on my art skills. I will admit though that this book is rather for someone who is intermediate in illustration not so much a beginner since there is alot of techniques that are kinda a refresher course for an artist not really someone who is just starting out in art. but all-in-all it's a good read. great for refrences^^,2
"Edward? Can you hear me?: I'm reviewing this early; I still have about 70 pages to go. I'vejust been introduced to Gil and I don't trust him. (sly as a fox?) Maybe I'll be surprised. I like the book so far, although Iwill admit all the sex started to get monotonous until I realizedit was, for the most part, necessary as it is part of Anita's""evolution"". At this point I'm hoping she and Nathanial can staytight without something coming between. I really like him and don't want him to get too ""weird"". So, that really just leavesme with one complaint - Where's Edward? I love his character andthe way he and Anita interact. If there's a next novel, please bring him back.",2
"A simple pleasure: Depending on your mood, this is either one of the funniest movies you have ever seen, or the dumbest.",2
"Love this tool: We have a 25-foot avocado tree, so when the fruit matures, we are eating them constantly for five months. This tool is perfect for the size and shape of our avocados, which is larger than the ""Haas"" but smaller than the typical Florida variety. Most of the time, the flesh comes out in one swipe. I have one for myself, and with this purchase, sent 3 to our family up north for Thanksgiving (with avocados, of course!). They all have told me they love it, too!",2
"YES!!: Fantastic item!! Easy to use, works exactly as stated, and cleans up with little effort. A huge improvement over a conventional blender and saves counter space, too!",2
"don't waste your time: I enjoyed ""Full Tilt,"" although not as much as I do the books in Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series. However, I knew it would be unfair to hold Max and Jamie to such a high standard. At any rate, I liked millionnaire (or is it billionnaire?) Max Holt and small-time newspaper publisher Jamie Swift enough to hurry and order the sequel, ""Full Speed.""I tried to like it. I really, really did. But Max's and Jamie's behavior becomes so outlandishly stupid and the Elmer Gantry-style preacher who figures as the villain is so cartoonish that I simply got halfway through and quit in disgust. Why does sensible Jamie suddenly start taking idiotic risks? Why does sweet-natured Max suddenly become so arrogant and controlling? It was all out of character.By all means, enjoy ""Full Speed."" And then make a full stop. Don't bother with the sequel.",1
"KitchenAid artisan mixer: Great deal on amazon and speedy service. Performance is as others shared on this unit. The esthetics are good. It is heavy unit and hence good stability. Note attachments (pasta, grinder etc) are pricy and separate.",2
"What Battery?: I concur with all comments concerning the battery. What a piece of [...]! Although I don't have this Panasonic model (I have a Panasonic KX TG2215 - unfortunately, a much more expensive model), the battery is equally worthless. I'm on my second (and LAST) battery within a year. I'm giving the phone to my girl friend's elderly mother who doesn't usually spend more than 15 minutes on the phone at a time, which is the absolute outer limits of the in-use-battery charge. I seriously doubt I will ever buy a Panasonic phone again.",1
"the real deal: I used this book to win a Nevada State Championship for Cowboy Action Shooting last year. I recently moved, and found it easier to order a new copy then go through all my boxes to find the old one.Lanny really knows what he is talking about, it is well written and easy to read. Applying the new found skills is up to the reader.",2
Love NCIS!: Waited for the Ninth Season to be released and so happy when it came. One of the dvds did not work so asked Amazon for a replacement and they quickly sent a new set. Sending the former back to them. No problem getting it replaced and Amazon was super helpful. Happily enjoying Season Nine of NCIS!,2
"This was an excellent book!!!: To give a little background, I'm a 34 year-old male who has never read a romance novel. It wasn't until I was in a car accident and had an extended hospital stay that I began reading O'Banyon's books. It was after hours, and the gift shop was closed, all my wife had for me to read was The Agreement. I was reluctant at first but decided may options were limited and read it anyway. After the first page, I was hooked. I couldn't put it down! I left the hospital a week later and immediately went to the bookstore to buy every Constance O'Banyon book I could get my hands on. She writes historical based stories with the perfect mixture of action and romance. I feel that I am speaking for my gender when saying that any man could pick up this book and fully enjoy it. She is the only romance novelist I have read and the only one I will ever read. I highly recommend this book to anyone, male or female who is looking for a classic story.",2
A must read for L'Amour fans: Another of Louis L'Amour's great western collection of short stories. Being a fan I am happy the L'Amour family keep printing what they find in his library. Keep up the work!,2
"A soft,searching study of one loners belief of true justice: This book is sensual, violent, erotic and a true Great Book.Part of its appeal may come fom being reasonably ignorant of Danish culture but it leads you to many points that you might not have trodden without a push and when you get there it shows little bias then leads you on further.I can't stop crowing about it.Thankyou peter ,thankyou.",2
"Perfect gift for a tea lover or anyone who likes fancy looking presents: I got this gift set for my mother in law last year. She loved it, mainly because of its fancy packaging, multiple items in the box and the mysterious teas. But, I dont know if she used it or not. See, she is a regular black tea drinker, so most of these flowering teas might have been alien to her.So I think this might be an ideal gift for a tea lover who likes to explore or someone who likes natural/organic food products in general.I am definitely buying one for myself next time, just coz I love tea pots.Oh.. the sticker on top holds fast to the bamboo...and hard to get out.",2
"Good Advice for the Simple Minded: Rediculous book, written on a 5th grade level for those who are inspired by motivational posters and achievement buttons.Recap of the book: a nationally recognized specialist in Corporate Leadership becomes the student of a beach bum (fictional), who knows ""William Maritime.. a veritible business god. He was kind of a cross between a less flamboyant Richard Branson and a less explosive Ted Turner with a dash of Mother Teresa thrown in for depth"" (also fictional) who happens to be living in a trailer park.If a black framed poster of men rowing in the fog with a snappy caption is enough to change your professional life, grab a couple copies of this book",1
"Disappointed with Results: Unfortunately this foil shaver from Wahl did not live up to it's claim.The shaver is harsh and it did not prevent bumps on my neck from appearing after I shaved with it. It is so harsh that it can leave your face irritated for awhile. I'm African American and this shaver does not seem to do a good job shaving short and curly facial hair. The only positive thing about this set is the T-Blade trimmer which is a decent trimmer, which is why I gave the product two stars instead of one.",1
"Make up Mirror: This was bought for my wife as a gift, site unseen, which turned out to be a mistake.Mirror was too small for everyday use, but good size for travel. The 10x power was really too strong.Wife found it difficult to even see herself in the mirror so I tried as well and sure enough it was just too hard to see.Never even tried to plug it in to wall unit. Wife just did not like it, so I packed it back up and returned it.Kudo's to Amazon for an easy and quick way to return products, even from third parties.Just not the mirror for her.",1
"It's a hard read: This is an in depth analytical look at the human personality and what drives it. Ancient wisdom really, mind, body and spirit. Willard breaks the human persona into 6 elements (I prefer the trinity version), then breaks into an exhaustive proof of how true change must start with the heart. Some really profound points and observations are made. Worthwhile, but arduous. A simpler and easy to read encapsulation of the same idea can be found in a small book by E.G. White called ""Steps to Christ"" - that's a piece of work, and so easy to read and understand.",2
"""Twelve"" degrees of separation: The publisher's his godfather, his dad writes for Sports Illustrated, and mom's a novelist.

"Not So Commanding: Biggest issue is that while we're talking on the phone and another call comes in, the device interrupts the ongoing call with an overly loud busy signal. The call isn't ended but it's very difficult to continue a conversation. Also had a problem answering calls from phones not directly connected to the device. The device did not detect that the phone had been answered and routed the call to the answering machine.",1
"A Good Editor was Needed: This book was required reading for one of my education classes and copious amounts of coffee were required to get through it. The author's intent was noble but the end result reads like a first draft,(a very long first draft)a sort of stream of consciousness, in an effort, I would assume, to be authentic and true to the youths' words. I had to keep rereading to figure out who was who. I found the writing very amateur and the profound realizations almost embarassing. These few kids are not an accurate crosssection of our youth society (as other reviewers have pointed out.) At least two of the kids has been physically abused and another has an acute psychiatric condition. I think it is irresponsible to call this journalism, and to present it as such. I probably would have been better reading as a novel. Also--Did anyone else wonder about the incredibly well-adjusted Chris with the perfect parents and the many details of his life only a mother would know??",1
"analog old school awesomeness.: When I recieved Matter + Form, I was in a futureperfect listening rut. Becuase of this I was dissapointed in the fact this was not futureperfect version 2.Matter + Form Is different in almost every way.This album has opted a very analog sound. Many of the songs have a strong new wave influence.VNV and APOP have always seemed to pave the way For EBM to come, Yet change up there sound every album.Another way this album is better than Futureperfect, I dont want to skip over any songs on this album. Partly an effect of VNV's ability to write instrumentals has improved dramaticaly. 0ver all leading me to enjoy this album far more than Futureperfect. great album. get ready for the clone bands to jump all over this one. 5/5",2
"Awful :(: I tried very hard to forget the problems ive had with these because they are beautiful. But the crackle glaze eventually wares off (especially in hot water) and the dishes start to hold smells, break and stain. A shame too I bought two sets of these and not 6 months later Im already searching for new ones. :(Edit* I meant to give this one star but my computer went haywire.",2
"Doesn't go deep enough.: Although assembly does take a bit of work, it wasn't too difficult. My problem with this is that it doesn't have much weight to it to sink the spikes into the ground. If you push it hard enough it does work on soil that is fairly soft already, but for soil that has compacted from foot traffic the spikes just glance over the surface. I even tried lashing a rock to the handle just above the spike wheel, but that didn't help much either.If your looking for something that will help with upkeep on a lawn that isn't having problems this is probably okay, but if your trying to repair areas that are already compacted you'll need something more substantial. (Since this does disassemble fairly easily and was relatively cheap I'm going to create a ""potato masher"" aerator with the parts from this.)",1
"Levi's 505 Straight Fit: As others have stated, these are not the same ol' Levi's. The fit is terrible, the material is thinner and the quality is nowhere near what you would expect from Levi's. I have started to look at Lee and Wrangler as replacements. Also,Harley Davidson now has a line of jeans that are better quality and better priced ... and since I own two Harley's, it seems like the way to go.",1
"Desperate for Approval?...No. Just Seeking extra cash: There's little that can be said about apple that has not been said already, from a darling of the computer industry, the ""cool""computer company, the education market cornerer to abroken hearted corporation without stamina to go on.... Reading trough the lines of this book you realize how commited is the writer to selling you the idea that he was like Julius Caesar surrounded by traitors and not understood by his friends. Rather, he comes across as a uncaring, intelligent person that does not realize on time that he's dealing with human beings, that the money is not going to last forever and that there's a strong reason for adminting your mistakes and that is not to repeat them.",1
"The Duchess: I know what happens to her is so grossly unfair, but it was wonderful to see a movie that contained a mother fully commited to being a mother no matter the costs to herself.",2
"Somehow disappointed by the story not by the Blu-ray edition.: I thouht I'd find the same Keira Knightlay as in Atonement which is one of my favorite movies (I had not seen Edge of Love in theater). Her character in this slow-pacing lust drama is against her image. Otherwise, Blu-ray theatrical edition perfect in terms of image (of Wales and the sea) and sound (Blitz-krieg over London).",1

"Undesirable CD: Their past compilations are a hell of a lot better! The backing music bites except for 3 or 4 tracks, the rest is trash! This isn't what real dance music is like! Skip this commercialized suff!",1
"Very moving and inspiring: What a great read. I loved this book. I read it some time ago, but it's still fairly clear in my head. Monica wrote about life before and after her attack and how difficult it was to move on. It's very inspiring, because she looked fear in the face and overcame it. It's such a shame this even had to happen, because she never really got back to the top of her game. She could have been the best female ever ever ever to play the game, but that was taken away from her by a deranged moron. This book will capture you from start to finish. You'll shed tears for sad and happy reasons, and any sports fan should read it through. She's one tough cookie. I highly recommend this.",2

"Too disconnected to make a strong impression: Having read Kitchen first, I proceeded to read Lizard. I guess I enjoyed it; I did finish it and have few complaints. However, I felt that it lacked a certain fluidity of language and style. Who knows? It is difficult to say when you are dealing in translations. Whatever the case, there were a few redeeming qualities and underlying themes... Yoshimoto's skill for creating images that stand out, her ability to hint at bigger themes (although it is disappointing that she neglects to pursue them more deeply.) Such themes that she touches but does not tackle include the transitory nature of things, living a pop culture sort of life in a pop culture sort of world, loss/growing up, self-discovery, reflections on everyday events and how they eventually shape who we are, and the constraints of traditional Japanese culture and the changes within it. But Yoshimoto just touching these matters makes it seem simply... cliche.",1
Simply not a good movie.: I would have turned it off if I hadn't paid for it. As it was there was a great sense of relief when it was over.,1
"drop back a hundred years and punt: Orthodoxy was published in 1908, a hundred years before it became clear to me that I will never be the same as anything. Religion is an intellectual comfort zone for people who like a salvation that has more significance for them than anything the world can do. In 2012 I am discovering pure unpopularity as a reflection of the vile nature of consensus. An individual writer like Chesterton can do amazing things with Christianity. There are so many ideas to play with. The world could be a plaything for a god who wished to put the finishing touches on white supremacy.",2
"very disappointing: I had very high hopes for this game, as someone who enjoys the strategy and captain-level decisions, and the Star Trek universe. And at first blush this game got it exactly right - you are the captain, and you decide the strategy and then delegate (""science officer, send a probe. Navigator, lay in a course for Starbase 12. Engineer, divert max power to shields"" - that sort of thing). And the graphics are very nice, and the story is interesting.BUT, each scenario I played (and I did about the first, oh, 6) has a VERY narrow and constrained success tree - you have to do a precise sequence of actions, in a precise order, to win. I felt like a puppet. There was no room to explore various options, no multiple paths to success - you do A, then B, then C, typically as quickly as possible, and any deviation results in failure :-(. I got bored of the game very quickly.",1
"Would review it if I would have received it: I would have reviewed this product if I would have received it. I ordered it a month ago from BEACH CAMERA through Amazon... and I never received it. They sent me the wrong item, then had the nerve to ask me to pay shipping to ship it back to them. Needless to say, I didn't. So they finally sent me a return label to send the item that they shipped back to them. Beware of BEACH CAMERA!!!!",1
"Great film, but it can be slow in parts: If you are interested in Samurai, then you'll probably do better with this contemporary, urban drama than you would with most films set in Shogun Japan. If you've read the Hagakure, then you'll have a deeper appreciation for the moral struggles that the main character, Ghost Dog, faces. One must remember, throughout, that the Samurai must face death gladly and without fear and that one must, above all, honor one's retainer. Forest Whitaker does a commendable job throughout and the rest of the cast does a decent job as well. Most of the characters have some depth and the story is unique. It is certainly worth a look if you enjoy Samurai films or even just films that offer a unique take on moral conflicts.",2

"A Masterpiece!: An excellent courtroom drama with all actors and actresses performing above and beyond what any director could even ask for. The writing, directing, and sets for this movie are superb. I truly felt like I was watching the events as they happened. This is one of those films that really makes you think about how great our Constitution is and how much we must respect the judicial system we have in place. This is a must-see or must-own movie if ever there was one.",2

"It's ok.... for a boyband: Let me start off by saying the Backstreet Boys are alright musicians. 2/3 of them can sing, whereas the rest sound like screechng cats. However, in my opinion Millenium has too many slow songs, for my liking. Precisely 8 out of 12. More than half. "" Show me the meaning of being Lonely"" is too depressing, Larger than Life was the best song on the album, until it got played out by MTV. My favorite songs are ""Gotta be You"" and for a slow song, "" No One Else Comes Close"". But, millions of prepubescent girls probaly disagree with me, and thats fine. I'll just keep listening to their first album instead, and pull out Millenium when I need a reminder of how innocent they seem to be, and why millions of underage girls go gaga at the very sight of them. After all, I was there, and it aint pretty. And, when I'm in a bad mood, and need a good laugh, all I have to do is think of Nick's prepubescent voice singing ""I'm your bad boy"".",1
"MANKIEWICZ MASTERPIECE: Joe Mankiewicz was one of the rare writer/directors of the 1950s, a man who did it all. One of his most ignored and flawed films is the notorious The Quiet American. If you are interested in how Mank made his movies, you need to read about his trip to Vietnam in 1957 to film this story. It's in a book called A THINKER'S DAMN, available from Amazon.",2
"Total Bait and Switch - AVOID: The description of this product on the Amazon site does not match what I received. Like another reviewer mentioned, the product was actually shipped from the UK so it took longer, and several features listed as being in the product are not there, specifically, exporting/saving of loops is not allowed, and there is no library of 1000+ loops included either. It seems to me to be basically like a demo version. Also, even though it was advertised as being new in the box, all I got was what looks like a (used) CD with no manual or CD key - so much for upgrading later! I am returning it. The SKU should be removed from amazon or the description should be changed to fit what is actually being sent out.",1
"this movie was clown shoes: if i had to describe this movie with one word id have to say depressing. depressing as f@(%. i saw a movie with will smith that made me feel similar. i want to slit my wrists and jump out of a window from a forty story building and land in a pit of molten lava. in short this is the best will ferrel movie i have ever seen. almost as good as anchor man. no im kidding it really really sucked horribly and i seriously want to die now. i mean what the hell! this movie had the most god awful ending. my friends are being dic5s right now about punctuation and grammer and all i want to do is take a bullet to my head from having paid for this movie. i was waiting for like will ferrel to flip out and kill someone or like start beating the kid but no...nothing, nothing at all that was interesting. if you are suicidal...do not rent this movie...buy it! watch it over and over agin till you end your sad life.",1

"EZonics worst cam I ever bought: Not only did it not work but it also destroyed my operating system. I have a Windows 98 operating system and I installed the software that comes along with the camera without any instructions and the PC I was using for 5 years, quit loading Windows 98. This is the worst web cam someone ever developed. I bought it thinking it was a good deal in the goldbox offer but it ruined my Operating system.My recommendation to you is DO NOT BUY THIS USELESS WEBCAM.",1
Fluff: A lot of corny emoting and boring conversations. The transsexual subject matter was the most interesting/intriguing part of the book. The characters and plot were borderline anemic. I was frustrated when some of the conversations seemed to go on and on. The town conflict was what kept me reading. I wish it were better.,1
"The Best album of Flans: With this work Flans reached is peak. With a combination of more ""mature"" lyrics and superb arrangements on all songs, and all that without losing his youthful mood. The first track ""Alma Gemela"" is one of the best ever produced songs in the contemporary mexican music scene.",2
Illustrations could be better!: Cute idea but the illustrations were not great. My son was not interested in this book at all! Most children are drawn to colorful illustrations...,1
"Caught that pesky bunny in less than 10 minutes: The bunny in our yard has been annoying me for two months, leaving its pee and poop all over my patio where the kids play. Finally decided it wasn't leaving on its own and I ordered this trap, which requires no assembly. I used a piece of apple and my toddler son and I watched from the kitchen window. It took < 10 minutes to catch the little sucker! Now I'm just waiting for my friend to come over to release it, because I'm too nervous. Great product! Yay!",2
"Incubus can do better, alot better: If your just getting in to Incubus buy Science and Make Yourself. I have been a hardcore Incubus Fan for 5 years, have seen them in concert 4 times and have all their albums and I can honestly say this is their worst album next to fungus amongus. If you watch TRL then you would probably like this album. Too bad you dont know what good music is.",1
"Most Awsome Thing Ever...: ok this is awsome...pennroyal has 2 cds that i know of....the first was named ""this is a pennyroyal cd"". the second was named ""this is another pennyroyal cd"" .....thats the most awsome thing ever....",2
"Cliff Hanger: This is the last published book in Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series (as of July 2005). The series is more enjoyable if you read it from the beginning and the title of the first book is ""The Wizard's First Rule."" My best advice is to work up to ""Chainfire"" in the order the books were intended.Having said that, though, I thought this book was great. It isn't at all what I expected and has a serious cliff hanger ending, but it was wonderful and exciting just the same.I tend to like this type of fantasy and I like series because there is more time to develop characters and relationships. These books remind me a bit of the Katharine Kerr Deverry series, though I think hers are for slightly younger readers. If you've read any of the Deverry series and enjoyed it, you will probably like these too.",2
NEVER GOT THE TOY: WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED ON CHRISTMAS MORNING BECAUSE YOUR STORE DIDN'T DELIVER AND DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO TELL US IT COULDN'T UNTIL THE 27TH. MY DAD BETTER GET HIS MONEY BACK OR HE'S GOING TO BE PISSED. I ALREADY AM,1
"disappointing: The book should have been named "" the Tragedy of Estonia"".Langwiesche is an excellent contributor to the Atlantic monthly, unfortunately he seems to be under the impression that a book is simply a compilation of several articles strung together.You will hardly learn anything new from this book.Although he is an excellent writer he should really just sick to periodicals.See other 2 and 3 star reviews for more detail, they hit the nail on the head.",1
"Tasty and Healthy: This is a really good dip for vegetables and pita. The only ingredients are eggplant, tahini paste, and salt, so it is pretty natural and basic. I took it to work and popped the can, which is highly convenient for travel since you don't need an opener. It tasted fine, but kind of bland. There's a bit of a smoky flavor. I mixed in some olive oil, lemon juice, and garlic like the can says to do (if I only I would read directions first) and its really good. I agree from the other reviewer that the consisency is quite think like hummus, but it is not made out of chickpeas. It isn't the same as the babaganoush I get at restaurants, but it is still good for a can product. I'm a big fan of eggplant if made properly. You also get alot for the price, I can make four meals out of this. I will definately buy again. I also bought the hummus from Alwadi.",2
"Am I missing something here?: I wanted to give the DVD movie three stars, but maybe I don't understand the technology that well. I have a 56 inch Samsung DLP HDTV with 1080P; I hooked up my PS3 with an HDMI cable and just bought this Blue Ray DVD movie. The bright colors are absolutely amazing but the dark colors have more ""grain"" than my average DVD's when I play them. With the money I've spent the performance should be spotless, but that's completely not the case. Am I all alone or maybe something is hooked up incorrectly? I cannot get the movie to fill the whole TV as well, so top and bottom are cut off, which I believe is normal - not sure.Sorry, don't mean to ruin the five star performances, but very frustrated with the dark grain colors. It's very noticeable and was shaking my head the whole time.",2
"Wonderful fantasy: This animated film, based on the book by Peter Dickinson, includes a character named Peter(!) who is swept into a fantasy world on a quest. I have loved this story since my children were very young, and I recommend it to parents every chance I get. The good-versus-evil theme is classic, and the science/magic-ying/yang parallels keep me stimulated while the children enjoy the basic storyline.",2
"Funny the nth time around: I would like to echo one of the comments of a fellow Eddie Izzard fan, ""some other stand up comedians are funny the first time around, Eddie's funnier the second time you see him"". This is so true, i watch him almost every weekend just to get a good laugh or i need a break. There are times i catch myself replaying and replaying a particular spiel of his in my head for a given day, one day its ""Britain hiding India and a group of other countries behind their back"" or ""the Settlers running to the Native Americans for food during winter"".Another thing i like about Eddie Izzard, and this particular show is that most stand up comedy's have use the same jokes. I've heard one too many jokes about Easter and Jesus Christ and Bunny Rabbits and chocolate eggs. His version i feel is the best.Go out and buy this DVD! i juts ordered the Eddie Izzard DVD bundle of Amazon and i hope its just as good as Dress to Kill!",2
Hangover is Hilarious: This movie is hilarious. I didn't get a chance to see it in theatres. When I finally bought the DVD and saw the movie I could not stop laughing. I recommend this movie for anyone who wants a good laugh.,2
"Another fan of the Extended Edition: Many have already pointed out the mistake it would be to purchase this ""hobbled"" set. I prefer the extended versions, even the incredibly long third film (as I would be watching it at home, where I could, y'know, pause it if necessary). How difficult would it be to include the Theatrical Cuts, considering one of the main strengths of blu-ray is storage capacity (not that I've seen this taken advantage of yet)?So wait and send a message.",1
"Good video, better for older kids I think: I loved the story in this video but my three-year-old was a bit scared of this one (unusual for Veggie Tales). The morale is great, as usual.",2
Help: Would this be.sent in the mailbox or by UPS?And would it come in a case Please someone answer quick im buying this for a gift soon,2
"The very essence of Alex Harvey is in this album.: From ""Vambo"" to the warm and moving ""Hey"", this is truly Alex Harvey at his best. I'm grateful I live in Cleveland where Alex Harvey is still actually heard on the radio almost daily. Alex Harvey is who God would listen to if God had a radio,(and lived in Cleveland). The Swedes have a term for Alex Harvey's style, ""Vorgesetzler"". I think that says it best.",2
"Perfect Digestion : The Key to Balanced Living: A must read for anyone with any digestive complaint. It puts the responsibility of perfect digestion where it should be: on you. Not on pills or doctors. Easy to read and follow, I was very excited to find an easy way of eating and living that makes me healthy, starting at the gut level, something my doctor couldn't seem to help me with. It really is up to you.",2
"Shouldv've read the reviews first: I expected a lot from this being a cuisinart product. It looks simple to use and is stainless steel. However, I found that this device is the most frustrating gaget I've ever used. the Knob that holds the blade in place is ALWAYS in the way of any item being sliced and the force at which you must push the item being sliced is too much. I tried balencing this over a bowl to keep from catching sliced items on the knob but no avail, every item jambs in this. I think that cuisnart should buy all these back from anyone that has them. I too would give less then 0 stars if I could.",1
"these filters are great for my AC systems..: these filters are really great for my AC system. They do help with my allergies. I can use them up to 6 months whick makes the price seem lower.I sure do recommend this system if you can afford it. In the end, you can save on Dr.'s bills if you have allergy problems.",2
"Great guide, great price!: I have seen alot of guides out at stores but this is the best one out there! It has everything you need to know to beat the game, where to take secret portals to another world. For example,if you find the secret warp in world 1-3 will warp you all the way to the fifth world! That can save alot of time and stress because of the very percise controls, beleve me, it's very stressful to die right near birdo (birdo is usually the boss at the end of each level) or to fall off a cliff. The best part is that it's the cheepest guide on the market! This is a MUST BUY guide!",2
Goodish: the CD came a few days before expected but was not in the original cd case but a flimsy case. overall satisfied. got here quick and is a good working CD,2
"Cheap plastic torn on AntZone: I've just set the AntZone up and am not optimistic. The plastic is flimsy and was a little cracked at the bottom edge, so a lot of sand leaked out. I taped it up before putting the ants in, but that probably wouldn't have been a problem. Most of the ants are dead or dying. It probably didn't help that they traveled via mail during a heat wave. We'll see what the others do, and hope they don't figure out a way out!",1
Decent product for the price: We bought this seat cover for the back seat of our Honda Civic (2006). If fits decently well on our civic and the quality of construction is good. So far it has done a decent job of keeping the seat clean and I can still use the seat belts to anchor the dog in the back seat through the cut outs in the seat cover.,2
"Classical Goes Contemporary: Born, the premiere album from the all girl group BOND is a very nice, tasteful mix of classical music with a contemporary flare. The music utilizes both electric and accoustic instruments and the artists are definitely well trained in their art. Some of the songs are written by the artists and to truly appreciate their artistry, I recommend purchasing their DVD entitled BOND, Live at Albert Hall to not only get a first hand view of the level intensity each girl puts into their performance but to admire their ability to truly entertain their audience. The girls are also pretty which adds even more to their appeal.",2
"Makes hair dry, sticky, and does NOT eliminate friz nor help bring out curls: John Frieda sucks...but for some reason I decided to purchase this around 6 months ago in hopes it would work. It didn't the first use, second use...or 50th use. This spray is sticky and leaves hair in horrible condition.Do NOT recommend this. I am sure this is made for straight-haired girls like most of his products. I have thick, wavy hair and this stuff sucks. I can curl my hair with my friggin finger better than with this product!",1
Avery Sticker Project Paper - Excellent for crafts.: I ordered this to help organize my kitchen cabinets. Labeled contained jars to get rid of boxes in my cabinets. People love looking in my cabinets to see how organized I am. They look great!,2
"great brand,bad results: bought this brand of glue gun first because of the name and second because of the price, sadly the description of it being dripless was so false having owned different glue guns in the past for my business, it was time to replace, so i did some research and this model just stood out from the rest. could not believe the amount of glue it drips when just idle or warming up, unlike any other glue guns i have owned! sadly to say , because the brand name is so recognized for such great products, not this on!",1
"This diet works!: I started on the low carb way of eating January 5, 1999 and to date I have lost 29 pounds! Much of it is water weight (I retain alot of water), but certainly not all 29 pounds. I feel better and have much more energy than I ever did on the low fat diets. If I had been told in December I could live without bread, cereal, pasta, potatoes, bananas, etc., I would have said there is no way. However, I don't even crave these things! I still fix my family a starch to go with their meals, but I don't feel deprived that I can't have any - it doesn't bother me. I realize this has only been a month, but feeling like I do and losing like I am, this is a way of eating I can stick to. I believe that this will work for anyone, but especially well for those of us who have a reaction to carbohydrates. Truly, I don't miss them. Give it a try!",2
"Not bad at all for an old anime.: For how old the series is, it's actually pretty well made. If you like Go Nagai, a guesser to the end, or even just plain anime gore, you'll want to get your hands on this classic.The story line is excellent. Getting a model that is absolutely afraid of her devil side is very unique. Also, this particular plotline has so many twists that you don't know what to do with yourself. And it never gets too overdramatic. There is always space for light comedy. There are some parts in the show that get a little dragged on, but have patience with it.The worst part of the series is the voice-acting, which was usually the case in the early days of anime. Dubbing was never great in the 20th Century, and I am glad that it has gotten better. It isn't the absolute worst dubbing, but DeviL Lady characters may tend to annoy you because of it.If you are a big fan of Go Nagai animation, try this one out. Even if you are not, it can still be entertaining.",2
"All hail Clef: Pure and simple, this CD is awesome. Wyclef is the most creative force in popular music right now. He may not win as many Grammys as Lauryn (although he should get at least one or two) but his work blows hers away with its orginality, power and yes, eclefticism. I'd still love to see a Fugees reunion, but I look forward to many more years of Wyclef's solo efforts...I'm sure he is going to continue to grow and provide us with more amazing music. To sum it up, this is a must buy for any music (not just hip-hop) fan.",2
"DEFECTIVE AFTER 3 WEEKS: I purchased this for my car, and after 3 weeks, it went defective, dying on my wife while driving with my kids!What a pain, hassle, and headache. Took it to Firestone and though I ended up paying more its been several months and so far no issues. I know at least if something did go wrong they would just fix it. But this review isn't about firestone, but about this product. Bad product.",1
The stuff didn't mesh well: This book would have been okay in any other universe but it doesn't mesh in SW. Especially Waru what was Bantam thinking when they allowed this to be published? The characters need work.,1
"An accurate device for walkers: I am 63 years old and find that the old body doesn't work as well as it used to, especially the joints. I tried jogging as part of my training for a 5K event. I developed a pinched nerve in my neck from the pounding and acting upon the doctor's advice, I had to stop. He did recommended walking as safer form of exercise and cardio. Fast walking can be very good and does not carry the hazard of all the pounding. I wanted a device that would allow me to monitor my walking as well as my blood pressure. To track all of that in graphic form, I wanted a device that would save the data and download it to my PC. So I bought this pedometer and an Omron Blood Pressure monitor, and I am extremely glad I did. I have used my car to travel the routes that I walk and find this device to be both accurate and consistent in tracking the mileage. I couldn't be more pleased with its accuracy and with the printable output from my PC using free supporting software. It is money well spent.",2
"A definate Winner!: This CD is a sure thing! Anyone from age 2 to 92 is sure to get a kick out of this one. My 2 year old and 4 year old love it - definately one of their favorites. Eddie Coker presents us with a wide variety of music styles; from rock to country, reggae, hip hop and some tastefully done rap - all geared for the younger crowd and with some really silly and fun subject matter. Songs about bugs, dogs, whales... all up-beat and positive, and with a great beat that kids can dance to. I have bought so many kids CD's that we listened to once and just put on the shelf, but this one stays in the CD player at all times! Get it - you won't be sorry!",2
"Interesting, but I've seen better.: The premise of Mr. Klier's story was a good one. Unfortunately, he did not execute it all that well. Parts of the story were exciting and tense and it held my interest for most of the book. The book starts out focusing on Biblical prophecy but in the end, totally disregards it. If a work of fiction references actual printed material, I feel it should remain true to that material. There was no mention of the Rapture, nor of Christ's (Jeza's) triumphant return with the saints. There was also no tribulation. Also, Jeza's sermons seemed a bit too 'New-Agey' for my taste. The messiah in the book does not in any way resemble what the Bible says about the return of the Messiah. Sorry, this book just didn't do anything for me.",1
"Sounds great, looks nice!: These earphones sound pretty great as far as quality goes. They aren't made to block out outside noise by any means; no matter how loud your music is you're probably going to hear whatever is going on around you. My ears are very sensitive so I can't quite give a fair review on comfort... I will say this, that as long as I don't smile, they're comfortable. xD When I smile or laugh, they kinda press against my ears a little tighter, so it's a pain. But like I said, I have sensitive ears. Otherwise for semi to long wear, they're not bad on comfort and they look nice, feel durable and sound great. I'd recommend these to a friend. :)",2
"EYE OPENER: This movie is a must for thoseliving in a confusing world, where nothing makes sense on the outside. Yet there is an unexplained reason for each of our lives. This movie shares the insight to a troubled world, not used to hearing the truth. If you want to see a movie that opens eyes(WIDE), this is it!",2
total crap: i agree with the other review that this is a hunk of crap. dont buy it. i made the same mistake n bought it ... wow it sucks,1
"Highly Recommended for Those Interested in the Future: I attended a lecture the author gave summarizing his book. If you're interested in globalization, the environment, or any other global problems, I highly recommend reading this book. It was deliberately limited in length, so it is a really quick read... about 5 pages for each of 20 problems and an additional 100 pages or so presenting the general problems and his proposed solution.",2
dont waste your money my apple Ipad retina isnt charging and i am trying to get the people to tell me what to do beside throw it: nothing works and i dont have a charger now. I bought the 15ft cord for my ipad it doesnt work and i dont have a charger for it now i have a apple retina ipad i bought all the items for it none work. the adapter. so unhappy. i depend on my apple now i have to figure out where to get all my chargers from a good dealer. before my apple goes dead. Didnt hear back yet from the company i bought the cord or the charger from yet either.,1
"Pearl Jams DVD collection (all 2 of them are a bore): Pearl Jam are more of a band of the 90s, and really they should of stayed their and done something else different because the last decent album they released was ""Yield"".Thats not to say ""Binuaral"" and ""Riot Act"" are terrible albums its just the production on both of them is bad, Eddie Vedders singing is a bore and the songs just are'nt their, thats not to say you should not have them in your CD collection - hah!As for this laughable Pearl Jam at the garden DVD, well that just reinforced why Pearl Jam are a band of the 90s, and back then they were an energetic and proper enthusiastic live band.Since then it blatantly seems they have become slacker and boring, fatter and unexciting and older (which is no excuse) to be such a bore on the stage.You would never beleive how bad this band has disintergrated over the years.No passion whatsoever, they just look like they are their for the moeny - which of course is a huge shame.",1
"Conneting new laptop to an older monitor.: I bought this beacuse my new laptop didn't have a VGA port. Connected to my older 20"" Flap Panel and it works great. Video and such are also smooth. I would recommend if your monitor has DVI input but no HDMI.",2
Not as I expected...: A lot of the things discussed in the book are very old school concepts. It does not have very good import-export management details over the Internet (electronic trade). How many people these days write letters or use Telex? A lot of the things are managed over the Internet. I was expecting more from the book which it does not provide.,1
"No more stained clothes!: I love this smock! My son is 16 months old and quite a messy eater. When we feed him anything messy, he usually rubs it all over his shirt. This smock protects his clothes completely. It tucks in under the highchair tray so it even covers his pants. Now we can feed him anything without having to change his clothes first or worry about stains. It also covers the highchair seat so we don't have to clean that as often either! It is easy to put on and take off, my son doesn't mind wearing it at all, and it's very easy to clean with a damp cloth. You can throw it in the washer too but we haven't had to yet. It works great for art projects too. Now that I have this, I don't know how I lived without it!",2
"Solid Effort: This is a solid introductory effort to supply chain management and the integral function and role SCM plays in contemporary business.The authors do an excellent job describing the importance of operational excellence in an age of increased globalization. The authors also do a superb job in emphasizing the role SCM plays in shareholder value, and how SCM can be used as an X factor in forging competitive advantage.The only fault I see with the book is the focus on speed instead of authoritative SCM optimization. Charles Fine's Clockspeed and other works handle supply, demand, delivery issues in a more balanced and lucid manner.",2
"These are tester bottles: I was unaware that they are selling tester bottles until my order arrived. Nowhere on the product info does it say this. I ordered it as a gift for my sister and now I will feel like a cheap person if I give this to her. With shipping, this price was only a couple dollars cheaper than the other sellers on Amazon who include a cap with their bottles, as well as the cute pink and white striped cylinder it comes in. This product does not include either of those things.",1
"Extremely happy so far: I'd like to echo what others have said about this video: it's clear, well produced, and extremely effective. I've been doing Phase 1 for about 6 weeks, and I can see increases in ab and core strength each workout. (This is partly due to my starting in a rather untrained state.) In the past many ab exercises have given me lower back pain, but I've been fine so far with this workout.Like the previous reviewer, I had to pause the video during the first several workouts to get the movements right. I also initially found some exercises extremely difficult to do at all. Don't let these obstacles dissuade you--they will go away with practice. For example, Phase 1 includes a side bend for which I could barely hold the starting position at first; now I am doing 7 reps per side, and adding 1 rep per week.",2
"Public information for sale: 60% of this book is a rehash of information publicly available for all to see on the web. The balance is made up of some observations of the relative utility of candle work and other operations. The problem with this book is that you can buy an Anna Riva book (Not that I am suggesting that is a substitute) that is reasonably close in content for $5. But then again, you wouldn't get the fancy cover. I bought it and reviewed it and dropped into my ""Second tier"" books. The herbal and magickal formulary used in this book is all over the web. Buying it for the high price is not worth it in my view. The only justification for buying this book is if you have no clue about the topic and are just beginning. Given the cover it appears to be designed for that crowd.",1
"LAME!: I thought the first movie was pretty good, the second transcends from it but it it keeps you hanging on by a thread and then Julia Roberts gets the bright idea to disguise herself as....Julia Roberts, some might think this idea is bright and funny but I thought it was lame, the only good thing about this movie is Catherine Zeta Jones, she was wonderful in this movie but it doesn't help it any.",1
Fun reflex anime game: One of the reflex anime games on the Sega CD system. They don't make them like this anymore!!,2
"Can't complain a bit: Although my original 2 NiMH batteries are now shot, and the replacements aren't cheap, I can't complain. I've had the drill over 6 years now. Used it for a year, still ok. Then drove a couple of thousand tile backerboard screws, still ok. Used it to mix bucket after bucket of tile mud and grout, still ok. I then used it to build my entire 400 sq ft deck, drilled every hole and drove every deck screw, still ok. Recharged the batteries hundreds of times and when they finally went south they did it pretty quickly and both at the same time. Since this drill refuses to die, I'll gladly feed it two more batteries.",2
"Not as much fun as it appears!!: This toy looks like it would be very exciting, but in fact the only things our son's interested in are the animals that connect to it and make the appropriate animal noises when squeezed and the ball. We have put the ""mat"" part away and our son now plays with the accesories that came with it.",1
"if you love pam: This film is supposed to be a lot of fun, not an oscar contender, and it does this very well. The best part for me was the first 5 mins, this is why pam was put on this earth, so if you like pam in all her glory then buy this film.",1
"Great--if the chipset didn't keep overheating: Great piece of hardware--very configureable. I especially appreciate the option to set the MAC address for the internet side, because my ISP will only give out IP's over DHCP to the MAC address I originally supplied. I got it set up in minutes and used it for 3 days straight without problems. Then it stopped working for no apparent reason. Unplugged it briefly, tried again. No luck. Unplugged it for the night, and it worked the next day... for an hour or so. Basically, something inside is overheating. I have to leave it unplugged for several hours before it will work again. No wonder netgear is ditching these at such a low price--there is a major engineering slip-up.",1
"This is NOT non-stick!: I bought this pan based on KitchenAid's (well-earned) good reputation and my excellent experience with silicone baking mats (Matfer Exopat). Unfortunately, this pan does not perform anything like silicone baking mats, and it's surprising KitchenAid would put its name on it. A couple of hints that this would not work: first, this pan's silicone is not the same shiny, slick stuff as the Matfer or Silpat baking mats--you can see it and feel it in its dull, rougher texture. Second, the brief instructions call for oiling the pan (!)--why should silicone have to be oiled? I went ahead anyway, with horrible results. Cranberry-orange loaves stuck badly and fell apart; french bread and honey-wheat bread stuck; bar cookies stuck....The highest temperature I used was 385 degrees, and yet the pan gave off a synthetic, burning rubber smell each time--disconcerting, to say the least. I really wanted this pan to work, but unfortunately it does not.",1
"You Probably Shouldn't Buy This: I would not suggest this bag for any musician that has to do any consistent traveling. It is very light, but it offers very little protection. I had to commute on the bus with my tenor and it got broken after 4-5 months.",1
"Yawn: They could have made a 2 hour movie out of this and been done with it. It just seems to be pretty much the same thing over and over. Maybe if they had spent more time on character development, it would have been better.",1
"Three Veterans Giving it to us: As a young listener at the time this CD was released, I liked the CD alot as I came to know every song by heart. This is a pleasing effort from the trio with each lending their own unique qualities and abilities to the group. Linda is the loud belter; Dolly handles the bird-like, songbird songs and Emmylou takes the traditional country songs that require an authentic country voice. The material here is varied ranging from pure country to Adult contemporary, more in Linda's league. HIGH SIERRA shows the AC as Celine could get away with singing this song. There are some very touching songs that mean alot to me and they are toward the end. It is great to see these veteran performers come out and perform great material as such.",2
"Not worth $10: I really hate to pan this movie, because I loved the premise and most of the actors for other work. But, this cast never gelled and the plot dragged on. Worse, the set was depressing and it never got much better. In fact, it made the whole idea of retiring in India seem much less appealing, and that was only from the visual and sound track.I found the entire movie a waste of time. I kept hoping for a memorable scene that would make the experience more positive, but it never came. This isn't the worse movie ever, but it hardly is worth your $10 to watch it.",1
"Do NOT waste your time: I was expecting a documentary about how the Oklahoma City bombing was planned, carried out, etc. Instead, all this video offers are news clips from the day it happened. A complete waste of time.",1
"Not a bad deal: These aren't the softest toilet paper around, but with Subscribe & Save you're paying about a buck for each roll of 500 sheets. I don't have a car, so this is a very convenient way to get toilet paper. The 48 rolls come in a single big cardboard box that you can easily reuse for shipping or storage. Eco-friendliness is not my primary concern when it comes to toilet paper, but it's certainly a plus.These are slightly abrasive, though not as bad as the dirt-cheap stuff my college's dorms bought. As another reviewer pointed out, Seventh Generation also makes a softer variety:Seventh Generation 400-Sheet Rolls (Pack of 48).",2
"Not for little guys: Very disappointed in this book, right on the back cover it says ages 3 + up and I found hardly any mention of younger kids at all (except to say in some cases that you will need to do things differently with younger ones...different how? Thanks for the advice *eye rolling*). It seems geared towards school age children.",1
"Quality you can trust: An Ancient Muse is what you've come to expect from Loreena Mc Kennitt.Worldly musical pursuits using authentic world musicians intertwinedwith her hauntingly beautiful voice. Although a hair below its predecessor The Book of Secrets, An Ancient Muse still deliers very evocative melodies whether they be a loud bombastic whirling dervishkind of feel in some songs or subtle celtic whispers in them. There is no ""Mummer's Dance"" or single on here but who says there has to be.The common complaint is that she's repeating the same CD as the last,but who says she has to reinvent the wheel with every release?Lorenna has carved her own niche and probably has such highstandards for herself it's hard to imagine a less than stellar effort from her. Bottom line, if you were a fan before this you should have no problem enjoying this. If you weren't, this won't bringyou on board.",2
"Too light on humor, too thin on style: I know humor is subjective, but I just didn't laugh at this book. I might have chuckled once or twice, but all in all it doesn't stack up well against a lot of similarly themed (and titled) books that do a much better job of parodying the self-help manual. The tone never felt right, and it seemed like the author didn't have many ideas. This is an odd example, but one thing that made the book feel thin is that the illustrations (quite nice, btw) were captioned with a direct quote from the text, not even a rephrase - no additional jokes were written.I don't want this review to come off as mean spirited or anything. Ultimately this book is best described as harmless - which for a humor book is never a good thing.",1
"Better on VHS!!!: This is the WORST transfer to DVD I've ever seen!!! I think the VHS copy looks and sounds better, do NOT waste your money!!!",1

"Not for everyone: If you like movies like Winter's Bone, No Country for Old Men and etc, this is probably for you. I hate movies that are too slow. While it has a pretty good script, the director forget that movies are meant to be enjoyed by viewers. You may like this movie but I don't.",1
"it can't be better!: I just got one! it's just awesome on video playback, awesome! my friend insist that i should compare it with PSP, but here is my point: it's about two third thickness of old 60G, and it has 2.5 inch screen, it play awesome video. what else you want from an iPod?! To be honest, I gotta say that the video playback even clearer than most computer screen. No block at all!But there are several thing to remind you, there is no POWER Adapter in case, and they trade off a like-leather case. check the size of the new iPod, i don't think any solid old iPod case fits perfectly.New iPod has screen lock function, like chubb lock. that's interesting! Since i just got it less than 2 hours, i can't give more information about the battery or other new functions. But, no doubt, it fullfills me really well. Take it, it will never turn you down!",2
"$250 is too much: Pretty much overpriced, but it is an OK system if you can afford it. For half the price, you can get a Nintendo DS, which has a higher customer satisfaction rating here at amazon. Or for 1/4 of the price, you can get a gameboy advance SP or a micro. No i'm not a nintendo fanboy but they currently offer a better value to gaming. Sony is more like $$$ony these days.",1

"Cheap edition of a GREAT game: I was so excited to remember this game and finally purchase it for myself! I grew up on this and have now graduated from college. I remember so many good times playing this with my mother and sister! Once my younger siblings were born, it was a pleasure again to share the fun. It's an easy game to learn, and we started teaching them when they were 7. I was happy to found this edition since the cards are the same ones in my mother's deck.I just received this item today and I'm disappointed, however. The car-shaped tray is one of the cheapest things I've ever seen! I guess it's just that the don't make things as well as they used to... :(",2
"Best Straight Mustard Ever: When you say ""mustard"" this is the stuff you should mean-- fragrant, acidic, sublime. Unfortunately, the price reflects not only the wretched value of the dollar against the Euro, but a 100% tax imposed by the US government! Imposed during the Clinton years, the 100% tariff on French Mustard still remains on the books-- and it's more than high time it came off! Write your Senators and Reps-- I just picked up two jars in Paris at an overpriced shop there-- at under 10 Euros each!If you can't wait, though, for the wheels of government to grind this mustard fine, exceedingly fine, then pony up the extra dosh and get some. Me, I'll be bringing a bigger suitcase next time, and considerably more than two jars home with me!",2
"Frustration: We bought the x-wing for my 8-year old. He put it together easily enough. He enjoyed how it looked and playing with it. He doesn't play with his toys rough but the movable wings and jets kept falling off and its frustrating for him and me to keep putting them back on. So if you want to build this thing for looks fine, but if your child hopes to play with it that may be another story. It has been a good tool for teaching him about lego reengineering and not trusting instructions. But at what these guys charge for a few plastic pieces -- they should put more thought into their design. Funny, legos made their reputation on these things but I found my kid's megablocks probuild set holds together much better. I wouldn't get x-wing again, but if you must the price was $59.99 at toys r us. Got to go, have to rebuild those wings! Break out the glue gun.",1
"I found it to be biased and dated: It's hard to find a travel book that is more than a list of hotels but less than a travelog. I thought this book was it -- but I was wrong. Boyde Lafayette De Menthe writes as if every American doesn't want to experience the real Japan. And describes the real Japan is some sort of secret brothel.Some of the history was interesting and the quick guide to the language was informative but, overall, the information was very dated (copyright 1995). And as a woman who loves to travel, this book left me with very few insights other than where I should sent my male companions at night.",1
"Complete and utter waste of time: Wow, where to begin...rather than rehash the 1 star comments, I will concisely say that this book is not worth the read. I kept waiting for some type of meaningful connection between the short stories, but the only connection is that each story references a previous story. The difficult diction from the first story and sixth story was frustrating, and the pointless nature of most of the stories made me wish I could have my life back that I wasted reading this book. Other than the Somni story, this book was terrible. If you want to read a great book, try Cutting For Stone, Life of Pi, Dragon Girl series, or Game of Thrones (except for book 5, which is pointless and does almost nothing to advance the plot - much like Cloud Atlas).",1
"Even Good Enough for Writers and Studied Readers: I have devoured all O'Brian's works and am wandering the Amazon site aimlessly, hoping to one day discover a new release from the author. O'Brian's tales are a delight for the craftmanship: the way he has built the friendship between Aubrey and Maturin, the tales woven within tales, and the masterful intertwining of the consequences of events from one installment with the plot six books later. I compare O'Brian in scope and ability to Tolstoy. Comparisons to other authors of sea tales or stories from the Napoleanic Wars are irrelevant. This author deserves comparison for his superb writing. The suspense and intrigue, excitement and historical education are all just side benefits",2

"Preparation needed for the book: A simultaneous reading of articles written by Stroustrup can be very helpful in understanding the book. Consider for instance the article, ""What is object oriented programming,"" published in IEEE Spectrum, 1986. In this article, Stroustrup first lays out different paradigms used by various programming languages, and then moves on to elaborate those which are essential for a language to be labeled object-oriented.To my mind, the book is essentially an expansion of the articles. In some respects I have found the articles to be more enlightening because there you see Stroustrup on front lines pounding hard on competitors. It's easy to get lost in the book but the articles are focused.Undeniably, a preparation is needed for the book. There are many books ...",2
"A true classic. This Kindle edition leaves some things to be desired.: What can I say about this work that has not already been said in the many reviews that came before? It is truly one of the greats of English literature, and re-reading it as an adult is a pleasure that reaps even more rewards than when I read it as a girl.My only warning is for those who are reading it in the Kindle edition. The good points are that it is nicely formatted and almost free of spelling errors. The negatives are that it has no Table of Contents, linked or otherwise; and although it claims to be illustrated, no illustrations were included in the version I read.For pure reading pleasure, this novel has few equals. For formatting, you might be able to find better.",2
"The Printed Word is not Nelson's Forum: I was very disappointed with this book. Being a huge Mystery Science Theatre Fan and finding Nelson's writing for that show to be near genius in its cleverness and resourcefulness, I was eager to read this book. Perhaps the book format just doesn't lend itself to his wit. I forced myself to struggle through a portion of the book, rarely giving up on a book I did give up on this one,it just was not funny or even mildly amusing. If you like MST3K, I recommend you stick with the tapes. Sorry Mike :(",1

"Horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, and boring.: Horrible, horrible book unless you are writing a doctoral thesis. The author hates didactism, yet she does not explain things enough and give enough definitions. She spends the majority of the book quoting children's books as fluff to create a big book. Organized poorly. I only read it because it was required for my class I was taking. The book did nothing but give me a headache and put me to sleep. I cannot see how it has made it to print, let alone being the eighth edition. Very boring book that does nothing to encourage the reader to love children's literature. The author does not even have a full glossary or index. Many terms and definitions are in the chapters, but no in the glossary or index. The book is not worth the money spent for it. Waste of money and time.",1
work great: This is a really good item for med-thick hair. My hair is fine and they seem to move around alot. They heat really well. The only issue I have is one of my clips was broken.

"Leadership Spirituality: Moody Press has updated this classic by J. Oswald Sanders on ""Spiritual Leadership."" A godly church leader himself, and also well-read, Sanders provides a plethora of pithy quotes from great leaders, along with his home-spun wisdom on church leadership. Building off the motif from 1 Timothy 3 and the qualifications for an elder (pastor, elder, deacon, lay church leader), Sanders shares character traits that aspiring leaders should strive after. Perhaps if re-written in today's world, Sanders might have discussed more of the historical spiritual formation disciplines and how they apply to spiritual leadership. He also might have shared more about handling suffering in the leadership role. Still, his work has stood the test of time.Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of ""Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction,"" ""Soul Physicians"" and ""Spiritual Friends.""",2

"Here's an example of the faults of McDowell's logic.: I read this book, and I am appalled that anybody would be decieved enough to believe this crap as an exercise of logic. If you would like a demonstration of how badly his arguments work, I'll be happy to show you one. One argument of his that I had a lot of trouble with was his ""trilemma"" of Jesus, in which he deduces that since Jesus was not a liar or a lunatic, he must be the Lord. He seems to refuse to believe that there could be more then three options. This argument is about as valid as coming across a mouse, and deciding it must be one of the following three animals: a fish, a cat, or a mouse. Reducing the fish and cat out of the possible categories does not make a mouse a dog.",1

"Depression Economics?: Krugman's book was one I terribly enjoyed. Having had to read it for my International Economics class I found it fascinating and it really opened my eyes to some of the shocking realities around me. Having grown up in the 90's when the economy was chugging along, I never expected it to stop. I grew up in a microcosm of excess. Never would I wince at dropping $80 for a pair a jeans I had in several other finishes. I attended a pretigious university at the tune of $30,000 per year without hesitation, thinking the drop in the economy was surely short term and I would be in no tough spot to find a high paying job upon my graduation. Now I have begun to understand that may not be the case, and the economy really never was as great as everyone thought. I think this book is an excellent piece for my generation to examine.",2
"Biograpby-Celebrity Ghost Shories 9DVD: the title is very misleading how it is set up and with teh price , being Celebrity Ghost Stories 9DVD, a lot of people would think of 9 DVD's with this price for the whole season or seasons, very disappointed, also no mention of the minutes very misleading",1
Good story and funny dialogue but too much violence.: She is a good writer with good story line. The characters are good with funny dialogue. The violence and sometimes off color language are not needed. This was the first book. I had heard good review about the series but I was disappointed.,1

"Be careful!: I thought this gavel would be a useful addition to my burgeoning low-budget dental practice. However, the night after it arrived I woke up to find the gavel trying to have sex with me. I explained to it that I wasn't interested in that type of relationship, and it was really sullen about the whole thing. Now it just sits on the couch watching ""Home Improvement"" with the sound turned down and listening to that one Dramarama song. It's incredibly tiresome. Thanks a lot, Godinger.",1

"Great movie on RFK: This movie is excellent for a film version of Bobby Kennedy's life. As always, documentaries are best but this does provide an accurate and alternative viewpoint of his life. The movie starts off after the assassination of JFK and goes into more of his Senate work and ends with his Presidential campaign. All in all it was a great movie and accurate.",2

"Really terrible shave: I spent about 10 days trying to get ""used"" to this shaver. No matter what I did, I could not get a close shave. That's an understatement actually. The shave was just terrible and uneven. I spent at least 10 minutes on each attempt and every time I would have to go over and over and over and over again the same area and not get any closer. I tried two different razor blades with same result. I am surprised to see all the high marks from everyone else. I must have gotten a bad one, or maybe my skin type is so different from everyone else. I decided to give another shot to Merkur and ordered an adjustable Merkur Futur razor. My hope is that I can get a closer shave with that one since I'll be able to adjust for a closer shave. The only upside with this razor was that I never got cut or any irritation - again, b/c the shave was not even close to being close. Definitely was not worth the money I spent on this junk. You'd be better off with a BIC razor.",1
"NON SPLASH Knockoff ... be careful!: No where in the description have they said it's not a splash. As if that is not important!Intentional of course to make you buy it with no return policy either.The original product is my favorite and I had many compliments on it however, this one hardly smells like it and is much more diluted. It doesn't even burn after a shave!Waste of money!Be ware of false advertisement which is why I give it one star coz there is no Zero stars!",1

"The Nazi's should've burned this one: I'm struggling to make it through this book, although I liked the other novels in the Indiana Jones series. This book doesn't seem to actually be about Indiana Jones; It's almost like it's about ""James Bond's archeologist cousin"" or someone like that. It is very atypical of Indiana's adventures, and the character just doesn't seem to be remotely like the one in the movies.I've read fan fiction that's more believable than this. I know it's a harsh thing to say, but this book is just plain bad.",1
"TR's Darkest Journey was very enlightening actually....: This book is well researched with the details unfolding in nice order. It is a very entertaining and an emotionally evocative read. I was so interested in it that it only took me about 3 days to read. (PS I'm not a fast reader) You couldn't make up an adventure fiction novel as good as ""The River of Doubt"" which is true! Its a must read for adventure seekers. If you are planning a trip through the Amazon, (even though we're a hundred years past TR's expedition), I promote this as required reading. Very enjoyable and educational. It was historically wonderful. Thank you Candice!",2
"Avoid this Mic!!!: You're really taking a gamble with this mic. I plugged it in and followed all the instructions included and its just not picking my voice up. It sounds like I'm 5 feet away. There is no way to up the gain and after a quick search on google, it seems that Blue knows that either there is a compatibility issue with Windows 7 32bit or that there are some bad units in circulation. Avoid this mic! I'm heading to Guitar center tomorrow because they have some in stock and I'm going to gamble again...but this Snowball is getting thrown back to amazon. BTW, the copyright under my box was 2009.If you search google, there are a lot of people angry with the Blue Snowball and their customer service is known far and wide to be lacking. They need to revamp and/or get a good PR person to repair their image.",1

Instead check out Extras, the new Ricky Gervais series, or the League of Gentlemen, for a dark treat.",1
"The Essence of Tower of Power Finally Captured: After following this band for decades, I've always felt that there was a distinct gap between hearing Tower of Power live and on a recording. Tower of Power is a band meant to be heard live. This CD has practically eliminated that gap. The perfomances here are stellar and so, so, funky, and the recording is of an amazingly high caliber, especially for being live. Order this recording immediately, if not sooner. You will be amazed and totally satisfied.",2
"Fails to deliver: I don't know how Out of Sight made the New York Times bestseller list when it came out. This book could have been written by a high schooler. The plot is nothing to write home about and Elmore's writing style is sub-par. The book lacks suspense. I knew (and you will, too) exactly how the book was going to end about 10 pages into it. The book is also lacking in emotion and description. It reads like this: Foly said, ""..."" She said, ""..."" He said, ""..."" The she said, ""..."" Get the idea? The book is a very easy read that could maybe entertain you for the weekend, but don't expect to be wowed by ""the best crime novelist of our time"".",1
"an elequently told story: I don't think any single book can broach all of the facets of dying, death, and grieving; but for children facing the prolonged terminal illness of a loved one, this book can be a very useful tool for parents or caregivers in engaging a child in a conversation about their feelings about the dying process. The butterfly is one of the most used images to talk about death and it is very well used here.",2
"Well Made, Solid Feel: This is great cable. My purpose in buying it is to connect a physical desktop system to a switch which is a few feet away. Since there are no obstructions between the system and the switch, this works fine -- that is to say, I don't have any cable routing challenges here. This cable is thick enough at the connector ends that you need to give careful thought to how to route the cable if you have a long run, but for 7 feet of wire this is not an issue for me. The cable feels and is in fact well made. I wish there were more color choices, but perhaps cables can be color coded at each end with bands of colored electrical tape or some such for easy identification in small home networks.",2
Love it: Can't wait for the next episode. Love being able to get them early. It is totally worth it. I have already told all my friends to watch it this way.,2
Confident Fondue-ing and Quick to use!: I bought this the day of a New Years party and I loved how EASY it was to use! I read the short manual before heading to the party and prepped the pot. When we arrived I was able to melt the chocolate and ingredients right in the pot and it was ready in less than 5 minutes!The skewer rest works great and the temperature control is easy to use. I love the magnetic cord for safety. After seeing many varieties of candle-burning fondue pots I didn't like the risk of burning the fondue. I was impressed at the control I had adjusting the heat on this electrical pot and I was able to leave it on low which kept the chocolate dip-able throughout the evening. I'm actually looking forward to trying a broth or oil fondue recipe next which I was hesitant to try before. This was worth the extra money I spent and is a perfect kitchen gadget for a true chocolate-lover like myself!,2
"Watch your eardrums: I couldn't get any air into this with my compressor, and blowing and squeezing the valves was giving me a headache. Ultimately, I had to use a piece of metal to pop open the flap at the base of the each inflation valve, which were sealed closed. After that, the toy's great.",2
"Don't Let Ghen Have All The Fun...BUY RIVEN!: Myst is the best selling CD-ROM Ever. RIVEN is all you would expect from a sequel.

I played it on my brand-new PII-333, and even IT seemed stressed out at times. If you have the hardware, though, Riven is a wonderful game.....",2
"not really for the psp2k: i just bought a piano black psp2k (mostly for movies while travelling) and thought this case would offer good protection while in my bag, which it does. the reason that i gave it 2 stars is that one of the best features for my intended purpose was the 270 degree hinge to make a stand while watching movies. unfortunately the psp2k headphone jack is in a place that's covered (just barely) so there's no way to use this a stand and have your headphones plugged in. the wireless on/off is also covered so that's useless as well.i think it should be noted in the product description that this item doesn't work well (other than protection) for the psp2k. unfortunate.",1
"Elevator Music!: I was so disappointed in this cd. It seems to me that the band took their greatest songs and zapped every ounce of energy out of them. They sound like elevator music, bland and out of rhythm with the way they are supposed to sound. I still love Bon Jovi, but get their Crossroads album instead. It has a great toned down version of Living On a Prayer that became beautiful instead of boring.",1

"""The lyrical King, from Da' Boogie Down Bronx!!"": ""Commentating, illustrating/ description given, adjective expert..."" were the eye opening, jaw dropping, opening words on the ground-breaking, mega Hip-Hop classic, hit-single ""IT'S YOURS"". Although the lyrics on ""IT'S YOURS"" were written by his older brother ""SPECIAL K"" (member of the Treacherous 3), T La Rock would later team up with producer extraordinaire and master of the beat ""MANTRONIK"", and put out a string of classic hits through out the mid '80's. T is better known for his superb lyrical eloquence and metaphor mechanics (and giving birth to LL's original style of rap. Just listen to his first album closely). Super Rapper T La Rock has NEVER recorded a wack record. All his joints are ""Funky Fresh""! This CD contains nothing less than classic, raw, B-Boy material. This is Hip-Hop in it's purest , rawest form. In T La Rock's own words ""strong lyrics, no gimmicks, no yes, yes, ya'll!""",2

"Epic film. Best of its genre.: This film is great on so many levels. From the acting to action, the look and the sound, a flawless execution in cinematography. This film was able to make comic book movies a viable threat in the mainstream. My favorite movie over the last decade by far and a must-see for anyone who enjoys action.",2
"Super Simple: This is extremely simple, one button, no synching with your camera, no programming. Just put the camera in remote mode and hit the button. This comes with no instruction whatsoever, probably because it is so simple. Does what is is supposed to do.",2
"Geez, really?: This book is two things, I think: a brief Cheney bio and an expose of what has to be the worst-kept secret in American political history. In fact, as Nichols suggests, I'm not even sure that they WANT to keep it a secret.What people might not be aware of is Cheney's extensive history of amoral powergrabbing and immoral policymaking, and Nichols assembles the essential evidence in the case against Cheney in a reasonably compelling way. These days, there's an ocean of books to read about the Bush administration, and rightly so. This one might not be at the very top of the list in terms of fresh insights, but it is quick and worthwhile reading.",2
"subtitles please: As a previous reviewer noted that Jane Eyre devotees will likely be disappointed....I will offer a second to that opinion.

"LGA-YYZ Commuter: What a great book! I can't think of anything they've left out. Five stars all round, but especially for being the most Web-savvy guide on the market. If you want an idiot-proof reference for Toronto in your pocket, go no further than this one. The others just don't come close.",2
"Good DVD: This is a good DVD, but my son didn't connect with it. My niece however loved it!! Great one to try.",2
"would help to be british: There is a genre of English folk music that has never made it very well here in the colonies.The musicianship is stunning,the voices great but somehow it doesnt make it. Think of Bert Jansch,John REnbourn,Pentangle and the derivatives thereof.Maybe its because we never had Chaucer or Wordsworth or the Battle of Britain....whatever we dont have the historical vision. June Tabor is very nice but I think if I had grown up in the Lake District I would feel more into it. Its sooo British,songs about England,King Edward VII....to be fair theres also Richard Thompson(but speaking of being sooo British). Ms Tabor has a very nice very proper voice and if you are a Brit you may just love it.....one other thing tho'..i really dont think the voice and songs go well with the accompaniment of the Creative Jazz Orchestra....wd work better with John Renbourn",1
NO WIDESCREEN? What a Waste of disc and My Patience!: If Disney/Buena Vista CAN NOT release a DVD correctly then DON'T BOTHER releasing it at all. It was shot 2.35:1 NOT 1.33:1 Why do I want to pay a retail price of 29.99 for 50% less picture than the film has. That is all you get is 50% of the film. If you bought this DVD I would ASK DISNEY to reimburse you half of the price since you only got half of the film.,1
"Something missing for me: As far as sci-fi goes, we can all do better. I mean, the characters, the plot, the subplots -- what the heck happened? I'm sure that Gray was trying to mimic the slice of life aspect, but he rode that starcruiser too many darn light years for my liking. There was no ambiguous moral message like you find in Clarke's work, just a lot of obvious ones like you'd find in Bradbury's weaker work. I do feel a little more comfortable with my sexuality though, but at what price? I could have been re-reading my Piers Anthony books instead.",1
"piece of literary crap: im only giving this one star because I cant give 0. The book doesnt reel you in like you'd expect. Nafisi writes so pretentiously that you want to slap her and the droning on about Nabakov is unreal. None of it really brings together a great STORY. Its just a bunch of rambling, and i honestly got a headache reading it. I am one of those people who can read long books, i have no problem with that, but this was brutally boring and just pointless.Also, i have heard many people in reviews on Amazon, and elsewhere that claim many of the books were not banned in Iran and it doesnt make the book much better in my eyes.If you would like to read a book about a Islamic society, well written with enchanting characters, read THE KITE RUNNER.",1
great 1st outing.: I went into thus read skeptical after a friend ranted and raved over it all night at a party. He's got questionable taste.He at last got his hooks in when he emphasized how truly the book fit in the noir category as easily as it did sci-fi.Takes some time to get the slang down since it's presented immediately and without context in many cases. But that just builds the atmosphere after one figures it out.Excellent read. I'll be getting the others in this series as well.,2
"Polder 30104-05; Poor Quality Garment rack: Do NOT purchase this garment rack if you are a salesman, or are going to place more than 10 garments on it! It is very cheaply made, and will collapse under the weight. The ad DOES NOT tell you that it is a Kitchen garment rack. Not for use by professional salesmen.",1
"Kung Fu or Kenpo?: While not a badly done book, The title is misleading. The techniques in this volume are very basic, what one might learn in the first 3 months or so of study. What is shown is clearly American Kenpo, and bears very little resemblance to any form of Chinese boxing. Basic blocks, punches, and a few kicks Nothing on history, this book would probably be of greatest value to someone with no martial arts experience who, due to circumatsnaces (such as living in a rural area where no teacher was available), had no other option for study.",1
Pruning blades: Great pruning blades for your reciprocating saw and the price is hard to beat. Walk into a Home Depot or a Lowes and compare the price found here on Amazon... Less than $3 per blade on Amazon while $5.40 at Home Depot per blade when you add the tax and that doesn't include the cost of gas to drive down to Home Depot. A great value for the money.,2
"Revolting production from a diseased mind: This is simply a lazy, dishonest piece of agitprop by one of the most revolting and vile human specimens I've ever seen. All he does is go up to simple, unsuspecting people and ambush them with insulting comments about their religions, which they are ill-prepared to defend. Did Maher really think he was so brilliant because he was able to baffle a bunch of truck drivers with some sophistic assertions about Christianity? Maher would have more credibility if he had the guts to match his snarky agnosticism against a real theologian with experience in apologetics. But Maher knew that he would have been the punchline in such a match-up.",1
Learning from experience: The shared wisdom and experience of the author made this a valuable read. The fact that there are a number of varying examples from real life experience and success at getting people to do things for the arts or the environment among many other activities provided different scenerios to learn from and to apply.I felt that the personal accounts or stories of his interesting experiences made it a good read in addition to useful advice.,2
"Watch out Starbucks!: Overall great coffee maker. Needed to find a replacement for my 10 year old Mr. Coffee, and chose to go with the Cuisinart DCC-1200.-Nice design, the matte black finish disguises smudges and water spots.- Great cup-of-joe, everytime. Then again i've had the same results from a $9 Proctor Silex at the office. Not to mention i use premium Kona coffee from Hawaii.- Auto features are easy to use and program.- I concur with a previous review, in that the water resevoir has a small opening and is oddly placed. Pour carefully.- It comes with a water filter....cool.- Fork down an additional $10 for the replacement Gold Filter Basket (#4), it's worth it's weight in gold....pun intended.- My parents have been happy using the same machine over the past year.",2
"Can the characters have their own voices please: Despite the fact that the narrators in these stories are poor, uneducated, rural children, they speak in syntactically complex sentences with preposterously broad, sophisticated vocabularies.Really, Ava -- the young girl abandoned alone in the swamp in the first story, who at 12 years old doesn't seem to have been to school in years -- uses phrases like ""her body doesn't ululate in dead languages.""? Expresses refined sentiments like ""infinity comes lapping over, concentric circles on still water""?Come on.In other words, they all speak in the voice of the highly educated MFA who created them, not in anything that could possibly be their own voices. That was a dealbreaker for me right off the bat. I'm surprised that this collection is as well reviewed as it is.",1
"Norse runes redefined a la Christianity: I found this book not only insulting and annoying but a real rip off, in that the meanings of the Runes were heavily Christianized to suit Blum's worldview. He should have created his own system rather than bastardizing an ancient system that has worked for thousands of years.",1
"Poor quality and performance: I purchased this battery from amazon on June 9, 2010 and on Jan 9, 2012 it failed the self-test. It is made in Vietnam. The original APC battery lasted slightly over 6 years. Whereas this one has lasted 1.5 years.",1
"A very bad title to a pretty good mystery: I had trouble putting it down once I started.There is a mention of women voting rights people planting bombsthat was interesting as I had never heard they had done anything like that.The idea that very smart people who are also good looking are hatedjust for being somewhat human is an interesting and probably true plot twist.I was rooting for the headmaster as the murdererbut she chickened out at the end...Very English, what?",2
"Permission?: I'd like to know why my daughter's experience at Fab Lab was used in this book without my consent? Let's see, she's been attending Fab Lab on Saturdays during the school year for 2years now. Why didn't that warrant a request or prompt someone to inform me of what's going on. She is a minor. I also read the section of the book that she's mentioned in and the information is inaccurate.",1
"Gorgeous Expensive Looking Necklace: Purchased this necklace for our mother's 80th Birthday and it was well received by her. Nice quality, nice size & length. The contrast of the gold and silver really made the MOM stand out.",2
"Great Boy Fun: I bought this product for my grandson on his tenth birthday and he thinks it's super. Unfortunatey, he is so adept at assembling Legos (his favorite toys). It's not challenging enough for him, but he spends hours playing with it and the rest of his Lego collection.",2
"Lyrically brilliant: Lyrical MagnificencePaul Simon is one of the greatest lyricists of the last fifty years, in any musical genre. His words are sheer poetry and this art is exemplified on this magnificent album. Some people curiously dismiss Simon and Garfunkle as ""passe"" or ""dated,"" but they obviously haven't listened to this record.What's interesting is that the hit songs from this disc (Scarborough Fair, Feelin' Groovy and Homeward Bound) are not as good as some of the sleepers. Listen to the simple poetic beauty of ""Flowers Never Bend with the Rainfall"" and ""The Dangling Conversation."" Another incredibly catchy tune is ""Cloudy,"" which never got any airplay but which is classy as any song Simon ever wrote.Paul Simon is unmatched as a lyricist, nothing Dylan or Lennon and McCartney (not even ""Eleanor Rigby"") can compete with the poetic majesty of this man. Listen to this record and find out for yourself or confirm what you already knew. A magnificent album!",2
"2 stars for respect of Eve, DMX and Drag: if Drag is even on tha damn album. im so sick of this ruff rydin shlt. DMX proved his talent wit his first album, and Eve wit both of hers, and Drag-On's album was terrible but i know he got it in him kuz he makes tha compilation songs great. but this cd i give it two stars for the first song on here after that it all downhill, and on #7 im pretty sure they dissin God, and if u dissin God u dissin his followerz, that mean me, so i gave this already burnt cd the hell away, dont bother buyin it, go buy some real rap like Talib Kweli or Wu Tang clan or even if u like ruff ryders buy Eve or DMXs first album.",1
"Horrible mixer: This is the first review I've ever written, but I felt strongly enough about this mixer to speak up! It's very disappointing. I used it once for a soft chocolate chip cookie dough. Even on speed 5 (which isn't much different than speed 1) it's pretty weak, and one of the prongs of one beater broke. Even before the beater broke, something about the design made dough splatter outside of the bowl, which is something I never experienced with other hand-held mixers. I used to make cookies all the time with my old mixer and never had a problem. I'll be returning this.",1
Great book for basic maintenance.: I am a recent mountain bike owner and long-time DIYer. This book is great for fully explaining how to perform all the work I will ever want to do on my bike. Good pictures to illustrate the parts and work to be done. Highly recommended.,2
Possibly the best space opera EVER written: How Cook isn't better known than people like Silverberg who don't write nearly as well I will never know.,2
"zzzzzzzzzzz: Since others have mentioned the plot problems, I will only say that if I were the hero, I would have preferred to walk into the sun. What an annoying heroine. What a pity, a good premise which the author didn't develop. Instead we get the same kind of suffering hero, waiting for the damn heroine to realize he's not a vampire...the bad guy...again and again...I couldn't take the repetitions. The reader isn't stupid. We got it, please move on!",1
"We Don't Need a Bigger Boat!: I have my McFarlane ""Orca"" sitting atop my computer monitor at work. I LOVE IT. We Don't need a bigger boat! This boat is tremendous. It fits perfectly across the top of my computer monitor. Beautiful workmanship in this model, so many details. I have the little ""Quint"" in the sharks mouth. It's fun to watch the surprised look on peoples faces when they come in to my office. As an artist, I can ""get away with it"". I totally suggest getting one of these for the fisherman in your life! I only have one question. Where is ""Brody"" and ""Hooper""? They get eaten? A little tenderizing, and down ya go! McFarlane, you did it again...great stuff!",2
"Bland and predictable: You can probably guess who the villain is before you even start watching this movie. Yes, it's that predictable. And so is the car chase scene and the sex part. I don't know what the ""director's cut"" entails, but the movie is bland and lame. Nothing thrilling or sexy at all (no, I'm not a desensitized viewer). Acting is Hollywood at its most boring, and the storyline just never engages. Mildly entertaining on a stormy Saturday night when you got nothing better to do -- I watched this over a tasteless after-work dinner -- but otherwise worth skipping.",1
"Harry potter and the sorcerers stone was GREAT!: I just finished reading this book and it was great. The story begins with Harry having to live with the Dursley family,who treat Harry very poorly and make his life misrable. As soon as Harry was sent to Hogwarts, school of whitchcraft and wizardry, his life changed and he felt like he finally belonged somewhere. Throughout the story the authors portrays good and evil battling it out in the fantasey world. This story is very adventerous and will make you want to keep reading. This is an excellent book and i would recommend it for people of all ages!",2
"Sensuality...Sublety... Qualities long lost!: Al hints at the ecxtacy and moans at the pain which exponentially heightens the expression of the soul....a point todays R&B artists are sorely missing.Court and dance with your seductee... don't grab their genitals..(or yours!)! This release serves as a reminder of how feeling is truly communicated musically. Check the last one and one-half minutes of 'Rainin in my Heart' and yeah, ""My Problem is You'..... 'You' is such a classic mid-tempo driving melody it could easily be inserted into any 60's soul collection.You can take a man out of the church but you can't take the church out of the man....at least when it comes to soul singing.Al Green IS soul..... through and through!",2

"""NO OP!"": First one lasted almost 1 year. I bought another. Lasted only 4 months until it too is displaying NO OP! This is a really good IDEA!!! But You take one good look inside and see the plastic gears to control the switch, It's CHEAP. You'd think they would just make a small relay circut to open and close it instead of trying to make the 1.5 volt battery open and close the Switch, Yes, the battery is needed to supply the computer inside since you wouldn't want the stupid thing to reset or have to reprogram it every time the power went out. I really enjoyed the first one since it lasted 1 year I actually went and bought another one Now I am taking them back to Home Depot since they are kind of spendy and I feel like I got screwed when I bought it the second time. I am sure the problem lies with in the cheap plastic gears that get jamed and no longer be able to open or close the switch. I tried to move the wheels but the problem remains.",1
"A complete delight to read.: I don't know how he does it. I mean, you start this book and , BOOM, suddenly you're in the middle of a complex story that is completely out of context to both culture and consciousness as we know them, and you can follow it. Swanwick feeds you just enough info so you can stay with the story. But never too much info, so you don't get a sense that you're reading something different that needs to be explained. It's an amazing balancing act.",2
"A Beginning Teacher's Best Friend: The Essential 55 was recomended in my Intro to Teaching class in college. This book really speaks to your heart, I pass it on to other newbies as well as other accomplished teachers. It is truly an inspiration to any and every teacher that strives to make a difference in the lives of their pupils. If you ever have the chance to hear Ron Clark speak at a seminar don't pass it up. He is truly an inspiration to all.",2
"Memories of Dan and Ed???????: Dr. Wise worries that Professor Park's rather off-beat review is ""simply disrespectful of the memory of these scientists"". That is a rather odd concern, given that both Dan Lindsley and Ed Grell are very much ALIVE. Instead of worrying about the form in which Dr. Park posed his praise, it might be worth realizing that, some forty years after it's publication, people still care about this book!",2
"The e-boat book from vangaurd: The book was fine, the history of the german schnellboots was very interesting. I was hoping for more photographs of the boats. I was hoping to use this book for building an e-boat model, but the limited photo supply was disapointing. If you want some history than the book is fine. If your looking for photo references this is not the book for you.",1
"Quick erratum to my previous review: My deepest apologies; I made a mistake in my ""full"" review of this item.Tracks 13 to 15, though credited as being lifted from ""Live Without A Net"" in the booklet, are in fact the STUDIO versions of the songs, which brings the number of common tracks with ""Anthology"" up to 8, not 6 as I previously stated.This leaves NOTHING from their live album! Now what other excuse do you need to grab it?",2
"Love it so far: I have tried this product a few days and it seems to work great so far. It is easier to apply than the liquid type because it does not run. It does not cover 100% off gray hair, but it cover enough for it to blend in. I find it very convenient to use while I give my hair a break from color treatments. I highly recommend it.My husband uses it as well and we think it works well enough to continue using. It blends in grays and it is not so time consuming as hair dyes (which in his case, being a man with very short hair, it grows quick!)Very highly recommend this product!",2
"AS ADVERTISED: THIS TRIMMER DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO AND DOES IT WELL. LIKE ALL SUCH PRODUCTS, IT HANDLES SOME JOBS BETTER THAN OTHERS BUT OVERALL IT DOES THEM ALL WELL. ONE OF THE THINGS I LIKE BEST IS THE SURPRISINGLY LONG TIME IT MAINTAINS A CHARGE. A GOOD VALUE.",2
"Buy this book: Oates fans will see familiar territory here: Alcoholism, emotional detachment, failed relationships, the dull thud of time as it drags us through a suburban existence. This is Oates' obsession, recycled for the ten-thousandth time.What's new to this novel is Oates' ability to cause the reader to abandon moral outrage and identify completely with the main character, Corky Corcoran. He's shady and often crosses over into lewdness that embarrasses the reader. But - why is this? - you start to like him. You give in, not because he deserves your love, but because you want to give it to him. Only Oates could pull it off.I'm an avid reader of the novelist's work, and this book is by far the best. Months after reading that final line of that exhausting novel, I still miss Corky Corcoran in my life.",2
Cheap ploy by Decca: It's pretty lame of Decca to re-release this old recording of Bell playing the Tchaikovsky just a few months before Sony releases a brand new one.Save yourself a twenty and wait for the Sony version. Bell plays the Tchaikovsky *much* better at 36 than he did at 19.,1
"Totally Dissatisfied: 20/7/05 I purchased a number of towels. I bought these towels for use at home and gifts for family. To my complete surprise and utter disappointment by my family on the very poor quality of the towels. I am extremely embarrassed. Yesterday I decided to use one of the towels the towel did a poor job of drying my skin and added to that the material was coming off all over my skin, I had to shower again and use a different towel. I have been a loyal customer of Amazon and have recommended your store to many friends and relatives. I am requesting a refund for those poor quality towels. I am also recommending that you cease selling those towels as to do so will harm you good image.I would prefer to give a minus rating",1

Firestorm NiCad Battery: Received this replacement battery promptly and it has worked perfectly so far. Old battery would not hold a charge.,2

Great Product: Have had this toastor for about four years now ... haven't had a single problem with it. Looks great with all my other stainless steel stuff.,2
"Play it all the time!: Over the years I have had several Celtic CDs, but this one is the best by far. My mom bought this while we were in Scotland. I ripped it and have listened to it for three years now. Finally I bought my own copy. Just love it!",2
"Fascinating reading material: Cayce's predictions are hard to believe, but what if his claims are true. He tells of light beings visiting the earth before humans were around and getting trapped in flesh boddies. He takes the reader to the building of the pyrimids and much,much more. This is a very interesting book.",2
"IDEALIZED GAY MALE FORM: Anyone who loves the male form will love Bianchi's Out of the Studio. This photographer is not erotic, romantic, nor pornographic. Rather he is narcissistic in the best classical Greek tradition. To admire perfectly developed male bodies, and perhaps draw them, this is the book to buy. But after awhile these beauties become much like Lil' Abner and the other beautiful men of Dogpatch, USA-- too self absorbed.",2
"Basic Electronics Course, for someone experianced: this book covers a lot of material and goes into much detail.but the author lacks in the ability to covay all of the materialin a way that is easily understood and readable. i spent alot of time rereading things because of the way things wouldbe explained and stated. explinations are refered to chartsand diagrams that are not well put together and labeled well.basic-electronic-course. reading that one would expect astep by step guide through explinations and some hand holding,but this book is far from that.this book should be renamed ""basic electronics course for theexperianced electronics engineer"".",1
Not the latest so it's not the greatest: This is a great book if you need to jump in a time machine and take the CISSP exam two years ago. If you need to study current material buy the Gold Edition instead because it's more current. The Q&A edition is very valuable as well.,1
"Wedding Invitations: This book was not very informative. If you have a good eye for decorating and a minimum of taste, this book was a waste of time. It's feeled with very limited ideas. The book is a rip-off. Don't waste your money buying it. I would send it back, but the postage alone, cost more than the purchase.",1
Questionable quality: I usually buy these from Trader JOes but thought it would be easy to buy a box of them. The two bars I have opened looked like the chocolate was crumbling off and smearing all over the inside of the package. They also taste a bit odd. I wouldn't recommend purchasing.,1
"not good at all: I tried this out on a number of people with varying tastes ranging from those who prefer sweet to spicy barbecue sauces. Nobody liked it at all, and nobody would give it another shot. With that said, I'll stick to masterpiece and doctor it up.",1
"Naive light-weight: This book has an interesting theme at heart, however theexecution is lacking in any real unique features. Much of the'philosophical' or 'meta-physical' depths of the charactersare simply naive renditions of themes discussed in Hofstadter.The translation perhaps was an obstacle to ennjoying the paceof the story with a very varied style and no real attention todetail or consistancy.The book does have the desired quality of a real page turner, though this reader was glad to turn the last page. Beter off with 'Godel, Escher, Bach'!",1
"fast service: Received book in excellent condition. The price was fair. It was cheaper than my college bookstore, but more expensive than purchasing it used at unknown websites. I prefered paying the extra amount for the piece of mind.",2
"Love it, some tape noise: Like the widescreen capture, looks great on a widescreen tv. There is some tape noise as described in other posts but not as loud relative to the voices in video. Had a problem with firewire not recognizing it, but turns out it was my airnet card, replaced it with a belkin card and all is good now. Windows movie maker 2 won't handle the widescreen and does a terrible job of resizing it, so I am on the premiere elements trial and I love it.",2
"Great Webkinz supplier: My kids love webkinz (of course). The service and speed of the Cashco1000 seller was better than ANY I have dealt with yet. I have been buying off the web since the mid 90's (""inception"") and am a professional cynic and was impressed with the speed, billing and packaging.",2
"Brush makes a dandy potatoe scrubber: Bought this to clean inner chamber and grill of my Infrared Charbroil 'BigEasy SRG.'Char Broil Big Easy Infrared Smoker, Roaster, and Grill. Noted the replacement heads are identical to the BrushHawg (long-handled version) and bought extras. Not only does this do a great job on the grill, but we have put one of the replacement heads aside to lightly scrub potatoes before baking. Does a great job with barely any effort....then toss into the dishwasher to clean!",2
"Great Restoration Of Radio Broadcasts Of Era Greats: I just wanted to express my kudos to Hindsight records for releasing 3 great box sets of Artie Shaw, Harry James and also the fine broadcasts of Duke Ellington 1946-1947 collection.It seems that copies are available at great prices here and this is not a review but an endorsement of all 3 sets as to quality and content.All come with great notes and booklet, superb sound all done with integrity to the artist...The radio broadcasts of Benny Goodman are found on Sony's 2 CD set which is also grand and for those collectors and lovers of big band it is welcome that this genre of music is still readily available with fine audio restoration.",2
"Actually a good game: I had a couple questions after reading the reviews like others but the game is far from unplayable. I haven't experienced any noticable lag yet (the kind where you are like 'Okay this is messing up my experience' or something like that) just a couple spots here and there that don't really register in your conscious until a couple minutes later.Load times are not a big deal either, although if you finish levels quickly in Portal they can be irritating. (The first couple levels are hella easy and you can pass them in less then a minute so having a load time every minute is a little tedious but as the levels get harder, it takes longer and longer to finish the levels so you won't be affected by it after 4-5 load times or so)All in all, its a great game, best bang for your buck imaginable . Also, I reccomend the Metal Gear Solid Essential Collection if you have a BC PS3 because you are probably into playing great games regardless of their age if you like TOB.",2

It looks good but made CHEAP: This Item was really nice looking but it is made with nothing but press board and falls apart so easy that in the shipping/packing process the main drawer came apart. now that I got a replacement another drawer and the seat are coming apart.This is a second vanity I have purchased but the other was from a different manufacture and it is 2 years+ and not 1 problem.I WOULD NOT recommend this product to anyone. It is completely made of cheap garbage that should not cost more than $10,1
"Great stories from old pulps: Originally written over a span from 1938 to 1979 for various fantasy pulps- mostly `Weird Tales'- these stories are great short horror stories. They range from the grim (Fearful Rock) to the almost silly (The Dreadful Rabbits, which I almost can't resist referring to as `The Rascally Rabbits'). Included in this volume are the stories of Judge Pursuivant, an investigator of folklore and occult matters, and the tales of Sergeant Jaeger, who brings both Christianity and folk magic to the Fearful Rock area, as well as a couple of unrelated stories. A couple of these stories managed to raise a chill on my back and that's not an easy thing to do. I'm looking forward to reading other volumes of Wellman's work!",2
One of the greatest games ever!: This game is awsome. It is a endless game which i have spent many beyond many hours playing. This digimon beats pretty much every one made so far including data squad which waas one of the cruddyist. If you want countless hours of digimon fun this game is for you. If not kill urself.,2
Justification: I have never read a book that makes Justification a reality of spiritual life and connects it with sanctification in a very simple and understandable way. I definitely recommend as a devotional to understand Christ and His work.,2
"An amazingly bad book: This book is one of the worst written books I've ever seen. I bought it as an impulse buy when I saw ""InfoBus"" in the title - I'd really like to know more about this. And it may well be that there's a lot of information here, but wading through the rambling, disorganized text is frustrating beyond belief. I made it through 100 pages, but I doubt that there was a single page that wasn't painful to read. I'm going to see if I can get my money back.",1
"For Queen, and Empire: The creator of Sherlock Holmes was definitely for the Empire first, England second, and history third. That being said, it is on the whole a good read although it drags at times. The writing style captures a certain late Victorian imperial mindset, not unlike the Sherlock Holmes novels, that is itself fascinating and historically valuable. I recommend the ""Great Anglo Boer War"" by Byron Farwell, which is both more readable and accurate than Doyle's lengthy work.",2
"A great read!: This book was very entertaining and it rang so true. The themes could be heavy at times, but is was never depressing. I liked that the chapters were all so different, it provided a sense of the character at different stages in her life. I loved the way the author dealt with all the different relationships the main character has. I highly recommend this book!",2
"Good puzzle for 4 year old: My son can't quite do this on his own yet, but he's getting there. I like the fact that it came with a separate picture of the puzzle to follow and it has very nice colors.",2
"Real life skills for a new era: Reading this book reminded me of the Citibank commercial a few years ago that said, ""Get rich quick. Count your blessings."" As the author so wisely and insightfully describes, we have become so overwhelmed by earning and spending that we fail to realize that we are already rich - with or without the material ""stuff"" of life. The life strategies described here are simple, yet powerful. And, written in such a way that is easy to understand and assimilate.",2
20GB Hard drive: Yes there is only 13.9GB of usable space... But for me that is more then enough memory for what i need it for. I dont dowload movies or music i just use it for moderate gaming. If you want to have enough memory just to save games on this hard drive will provide enough memory.,2
